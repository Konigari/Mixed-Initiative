Joint fluid is a transudate of plasma that is actively secreted by synovial cells 
It provides nutrients and lubrication for articular cartilage 
Examination of joint fluid focuses on those properties and constituents of value in determining the cause of effusions 
A definitive diagnosis from joint fluid findings can be made only in two situations  crystal synovitis and septic arthritis 
In other conditions  the correlation of joint fluid analysis with clinical information is useful in arriving at a diagnosis 
==========
There is no routine for joint fluid analysis 
Therefore  it is the responsibility of the examining physician to record a gross description of the fluid volume  color  clarity  and viscosity 
As a minimum  a white blood cell count with differential  a microscopic examination under polarized light for crystals  a gram stain  and bacteriologic cultures should be done 
Glucose and protein are ordered only if there is sufficient fluid 
Special cultures and chemistries may be indicated in unusual circumstances 
The mucin clot test can be done  but adds little to the viscosity  white blood cell count  and differential as a measure of inflammation 
Recent studies have shown a considerable variation in what various laboratories consider to be routine and in the accuracy of their reports 
Consequently  it is prudent to specify the desired tests rather than simply request a routine analysis 
The physician should develop some facility in performing and interpreting a microscopic examination  in the event that the laboratory is not always immediately accessible  or if the laboratory report is questioned 
The following materials should be available before an aspiration is performed 
  Betadine solution for skin preparation  Alcohol swabs to remove iodine from the puncture site   lidocaine for local anesthesia  Sterile syringes   for anesthesia   cc with  gauge needle  or  for aspiration   or  cc with   or  gauge needles  Heparin solution for flushing the larger syringes prior to aspiration  Collecting tubes   sterile culture tube  fluoride gray top tube for glucose  or  plain or lavender top tubes for blood count and other chemistries   glass slides   cover slip  Band Aid  Optional  Clear nail polish for sealing the edges of the cover slip 
If  ml or more of fluid is obtained  it should be apportioned as follows 
If a smaller amount of fluid is obtained  the first few drops should go into the culture tube 
One drop should be spread on one of the glass slides for gram stain  and another drop should be placed on the other slide for crystal examination and covered with a cover slip 
The edges may be sealed with clear nail polish if the slide will not be examined immediately 
Viscosity can be checked by observing the length of the string formed as the syringe is pulled away from the slide 
Normal fluid will form a string  to  cm in length before breaking 
Any remaining fluid may be placed in an appropriate tube and sent for complete blood count  differential  and those tests deemed most useful 
Cell counts and crystal examination can be performed on fluid that is  or  days old  if refrigerated  though there will be some cell loss 
Chemistry determinations should be done promptly or else the fluid should be centrifuged and the supernatant refrigerated 
To examine for crystals  the wet mount is placed on a polarizing microscope and the cells or other particulate matter brought into focus under low power 
Under high dry magnification  an estimate of the cell count and the proportion of polymorphonuclear cells PMN can be ascertained 
When the light is reduced by the condenser  it is often possible to see crystals  if present 
The polarizer or analyzer disc is then turned until the field becomes dark 
Birefringent crystals appear light against the dark background 
Although monosodium urate crystals are typically long and needle shaped  one should not rely on morphology for identification 
Moving the red compensator into the light path will produce a blue or yellow color to birefringent particles 
A reference arrow inscribed on either the analyzer or the compensator plate allows identification of crystals 
A common convention among house officers is the word BRAG  if a Blue crystal is at Right Angles to the reference arrow  Gout is likely the crystal is monosodium urate 
If the slide can be rotated  degrees  or if another urate crystal can be found parallel to the reference arrow  the crystal will be yellow 
Calcium pyrophosphate crystals will give the opposite color changes yellow when perpendicular to the arrow  and blue when parallel 
The color intensity of the calcium crystals is less than that of urate crystals  Gatter  contains excellent color plates of crystals and other particles and cells that can be identified microscopically 
If a polarizing microscope is not available but crystals can be seen  a drop of 
N NaOH can be added to the slide 
Urate crystals will dissolve 
A drop of freshly filtered  Alizarin Red S can be added to a drop of fluid on another slide  calcium crystals of any type will then appear orange under the microscope 
If heparin is not used in the aspirating syringe  a green top tube sodium heparin is suitable for crystal analysis 
Tubes containing lithium heparin or oxalate as anticoagulants should not be used  since crystals resembling those of urate or calcium may form 
Iodine from the skin prep may also introduce crystals if not removed from the puncture sites 
An anticoagulant is necessary  since inflammatory fluid may clot and yield a falsely low white blood cell count 
Saline 
should be used to dilute the fluid for the white blood cell count because the standard acetic acid diluting fluid will cause the fluid to clot 
Lidocaine may suppress bacterial growth  therefore  the anesthetizing syringe or needle should not be used for aspiration 
Monosodium urate crystals show intense negative birefringence 
Betamethasone crystals are also negatively birefringent and can be used as a standard reference slide by the novice 
Unfortunately  if this steroid was recently injected into the aspirated joint  it may confuse interpretation 
Calcium salts  including the oxalate used as an anticoagulant in collecting tubes  are positively birefringent  as are lithium heparin and some steroid crystals 
Artifacts such as dust 
talc  and nail polish show variable birefringence 
Calcium hydroxyapatite crystals are tiny and therefore difficult to identify on a wet mount  however  clumps will stain purple with Wright's stain and orange with Alizarin Red S 
==========
Synovial fluid is secreted by synovial cells lining the joint capsule  but not the articular cartilage 
The synovial lining is not continuous and lacks a basement membrane 
The subsynovial layer contains lymphatics and blood vessels supported by a fibrous joint capsule 
Therefore  a few erythocytes are usually seen after arthrocentesis  secondary to either capillary trauma or the underlying disease 
Selected components of the synovial fluid usually undergo predictable changes depending on pathophysiologic processes Table 
Joint fluid in normal and noninflammatory conditions is transparent  that is  fine print can usually be read through a test tube of fluid 
Clarity changes from transparent to opaque in direct proportion to the number of leukocytes that enter the fluid through inflammation or infection 
With minimal inflammation  capillary leakage of red cells  and the metabolism of hemoglobin to bilirubin  the fluid may become xanthochromic 
Color is also affected by the presence of leukocytes and bacteria  with pus being off white 
For example  Staphylococcus aureus may produce a golden hue 
A bloody red fluid may be due to trauma or other causes of hemarthrosis 
Less than  of blood can cause the joint fluid to look like whole blood  hence  a simultaneous serum and synovial hematocrit may be necessary to determine the amount of blood present 
Joint fluid in normal and noninflammatory conditions contains a significant amount  mgdl of hyaluronic acid  a high molecular weight polymerized glycosaminoglycan  which is responsible for the unique eggwhite like consistency and high viscosity of joint fluid 
In inflammatory or combined inflammatory infectious processes  hyaluronate may be fragmented by the proteolytic action of lysozymes released by polymorphonuclear cells PMNs 
This results in a decreased concentration and a low viscosity 
Joint fluid in normal and noninflammatory conditions contains white blood cells  predominantly monocytes  lymphocytes  macrophages  and a few PMNs 
In inflammatory and infectious conditions other than tuberculosis or viral disease  the fraction of PMNs increases in proportion to the increases in total synovial fluid leukocyte count  and the total leukocyte count increases in proportion to the extent of inflammation and infection 
Consequently  the major basis for classifying a synovial effusion is quantification of leukocytes Table 
Leukocyte counts vary over a wide range with some overlap between groups due to the variability of the mechanisms producing the joint fluid Table 
Even for a specific disease such as rheumatoid arthritis  the leukocyte count can vary from  to  mm depending on the activity of the joint disease 
Combined pathophysiologic processes may make interpretation of the leukocyte count difficult 
For example  patients with a noninflammatory process such as hemochromatosis may have significantly higher than expected leukocyte counts if an associated inflammatory process such as a crystal induced arthritis is also present 
Joint fluid in normal or noninflammatory conditions does not usually contain crystals  unless the crystal induced arthritis is in a quiescent state  or unless nonpathogenetic crystals such as cholesterol or artifacts such as previously injected corticosteroid esters are present 
The two predominant crystals that can produce synovial inflammation are monosodium urate monohydrate MSU in gout and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate CPPD in pseudogout 
Although the fundamental mechanism of crystal induced formation in synovial fluid is unclear  the association of crystals with the inflammatory response is well documented 
For example  it is rare to find crystals without neutrophils or neutrophils without crystals during acute episodes 
Less frequently seen are monocytes and synovial cells phagocytizing these crystals 
Whether intracellular or extracellular  these crystals appear needlelike MSU or rhomboid CPPD  yet both may appear as blunt rods 
Joint fluid in normal and noninflammatory conditions usually maintains a glucose level close within  mgdl to the serum concentration because glucose enters the synovia from blood by facilitated diffusion with equilibration 
The synovial serum difference is most reliable only in the fasting state because equilibration is slow and unpredictable after a meal 
In inflammatory and infectious conditions  synovial glucose is often reduced as a result of its utilization by the metabolic activity of the neutrophils and bacteria 
Joint fluid in normal and noninflammatory conditions contains about one fourth the total protein present in blood 
Coagulation proteins are absent  hence normal joint fluid does not clot 
Smaller molecules  such as albumin  are usually present in greater concentrations than larger molecules  such as most of the globulins 
In inflammatory conditions  however  the concentration of these components may be equal to the plasma concentrations because of increased synovial blood flow 
Synovial fluid protein levels greater than 
gdl are abnormal  and those greater than 
gdl indicate significant inflammation 
In inflammatory effusions  a gram stain and culture are mandatory to rule out a septic joint as well as infection superimposed on another condition  such as rheumatoid arthritis 
The lack of a basement membrane makes the synovium a susceptible site for infection in the presence of bacteremia 
Components of the immune system  such as antinuclear antibodies  IgG and IgM rheumatoid factors  and total hemolytic complement  usually parallel changes in the serum andor are nonspecific 
Other nonspecific synovial fluid measurements and their associated processes include a decreased pH inflammation  increased lactic acid nongonococcal septic arthritis  and lysozymelactoferrin ratio extent of inflammation  to name a few 
None of these tests  however  should be routinely ordered on synovial fluid 
==========
Analysis of joint fluid yields a definitive diagnosis in only two situations  septic arthritis and crystal induced synovitis 
Septic arthritis is an emergency because a pyogenic infection can destroy a joint if appropriate therapy is not initiated within days 
Purulent fluid group III mandates antibiotic therapy even if the gram stain is negative 
Synovial fluid gram stains are positive in less than  of cases of gonococcal arthritis  and a positive synovial fluid culture is obtained in only  of cases 
The gram stain is positive in  to  of cases of gram negative bacillary and staphylococcal infections  respectively  but cultures are almost always positive 
Cultures may be spuriously negative if the synovial fluid contains lidocaine or if the patient has received earlier antibiotic therapy 
Gram stain yield is improved if a centrifuged sediment is obtained 
Group II fluid is sometimes obtained in septic arthritis 
This may occur if the fluid is removed early in the course of the disease  if the patient is taking antibiotics  if the patient is immunocompromised  or if the fluid is taken from an adjacent bursa rather than the joint space 
Indolent effusions with minimal discomfort and inflammation suggest a tuberculous or fungal cause 
Appropriate cultures andor synovial biopsy are indicated in such cases 
The presence of monosodium urate or calcium crystals in an inflammatory fluid  especially when the crystals are intracellular  warrants a diagnosis of crystal induced synovitis 
Crystal synovitis  however  does not exclude a concomitant infection 
Therefore  gram stain and culture must still be done 
Furthermore  calcium and urate crystals may be present in the same joint fluid  for example  a patient with chondrocalcinosis may have gout  or a patient with gout may have secondary calcium deposits in an adjacent tophus 
Artifacts from the use of the wrong anticoagulant or from prior steroid injections may be misleading see Technique 
Calcium pyrophosphate is the crystal associated with the synovitis of chondrocalcinosis pseudogout 
Chondrocalcinosis may be hereditary or related to osteoarthritis  hyperparathyroidism  hemochromatosis  hypothyroidism  gout  acromegaly  ochronosis  hypophosphatasia  or hypomagnesemia 
Calcium salts other than pyrophosphate have been associated with synovitis 
Hydroxyapatite crystals have been associated with both osteoarthritis and an erosive arthropathy 
Calcium oxalate crystals have been found in synovial effusions of patients undergoing hemodialysis 
In the presence of bacterial infection  synovial fluid glucose may be at least  mgdl lower than a simultaneous blood glucose  providing the patient is fasting 
Rheumatoid effusions may also show a low glucose 
Synovial fluid protein rises proportional to the degree of synovial inflammation 
This rise is nonspecific and adds no clinically useful information beyond that obtained from the white cell count and differential 
Synovial fluid lactic acid levels have been suggested as a quick method of identifying a septic joint 
Lactic acid levels appear to be proportional to the white blood cell count  however  and therefore have no greater specificity than the white blood cell count 
Synovial fluid viscosity falls in proportion to the degree of inflammation  so that a very low viscosity of fluid with a low white blood cell count suggests a technical error in performing the cell count 
This can occur with a long delay before performing the cell count  or clotting of the fluid 
Extremely viscous fluid may be found in the myxedematous patient 
In conclusion  valuable diagnostic information can be obtained from analysis of joint fluid 
When standard aseptic technique is employed  the likelihood of introducing infection is rare 
Sterile gloves and mask are not absolutely necessary 
Therefore  a physician should not hesitate to obtain joint fluid for analysis when evaluating an unexplained joint effusion 
Joint fluid analysis is essential for the evaluation of a patient with acute monoarthritis
