Jaundice is the yellow color of skin and mucous membranes due to accumulation of bile pigments in blood and their deposition in body tissues 
Jaundice should be distinguished from cholestasis  which refers to a decreased rate of bile flow 
Depending on the clinical situation  jaundice and cholestasis may coexist or each may exist without the other 
Although many sources confidently say that jaundice can be recognized when the serum bilirubin rises to  to 
mgdl  experienced clinicians often cannot see a yellow skin coloration until the serum bilirubin is at least  to  mgdl 
Jaundice must be distinguished from yellow or green skin color resulting from carotenemia or quinacrine ingestion 
Eating large quantities of green and yellow vegetables  tomatoes  or yellow corn may result in excess carotene intake 
The resultant yellow skin color is differentiated from jaundice by the absence of yellow color in mucous membranes and sclerae  the normal urine color  and the accentuation of yellow brown carotenoid pigment in the palms  soles  and nasolabial folds 
Quinacrine  commonly used for treatment of giardiasis  may produce a yellow skin color  but the urine remains normal 
Serum bilirubin levels are normal in patients with yellow skin caused by carotenemia or quinacrine

The majority of jaundiced patients may be diagnosed by careful and meticulous history and physical examination 
These may either give the diagnosis directly or  at the least  direct diagnostic efforts toward appropriate paths 
Assessment of constitutional symptoms often provides the first clue to the mechanism of jaundice 
Anorexia  nausea  emesis  or weight loss appearing within  weeks prior to onset of jaundice suggests hepatitis or biliary obstruction secondary to gallstones 
The same symptoms occurring continuously for more than  weeks prior to the appearance of jaundice suggest a malignant biliary obstruction  chronic hepatitis  or toxin exposure especially alcohol 
Recurrent brief episodes of anorexia  nausea  or emesis extending over months to years  especially when accompanied by right upper quadrant abdominal pain  implicate gallstones 
The mode of onset of jaundice often provides the pathophysiologic basis  if not the specific diagnosis at its root 
Jaundice appearing over a few days to a week implies hepatitis  whether drug or toxin induced  viral or bacterial i e   leptospirosis 
Jaundice appearing over the course of weeks implies a subacute hepatitis or extrahepatic obstruction due to malignancy  gallstone  chronic pancreatitis  or stricture in the common bile duct 
Jaundice of fluctuating intensity implicates gallstones  ampullary carcinoma  or possible drug hepatitis 
A past history of jaundice  although potentially unrelated to the immediate problem  may implicate chronic hepatitis  cirrhosis  benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis  or a genetic nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemeia i e   Gilbert's or Dubin Johnson syndrome as the cause 
Symptoms associated with jaundice often provide a diagnosis 
Abdominal pain frequently accompanies jaundice  and its character may point to a specific diagnosis 
Although hepatocellular jaundice is usually painless  a dull ache or heavy sensation in the right upper quadrant may attend acute hepatitis of any cause 
Pain associated with alcoholic hepatitis  especially when accompanied by fever  jaundice  and leukocytosis  may be sufficiently severe to simulate an acute surgical abdomen Mendenhall  f 
Right upper quadrant abdominal pain occurring episodically over months to years  and especially when radiating to the right scapular area  right shoulder  or around the upper abdomen and back in a girdle distribution  suggests gallstones 
Persistent epigastric or right upper quadrant pain possibly radiating to the back suggests carcinoma of the head of the pancreas 
Fever frequently accompanies jaundice caused by acute hepatitis  although it usually lasts no more than a few days 
Fever associated with chills usually points to biliary obstruction  especially due to stones or stricture and  less frequently  to malignancy 
Generalized pruritus usually points to biliary tract obstruction as the cause of jaundice 
Recent onset localizes the level to the large ducts i e   neoplasm or canaliculi intrahepatic cholestasis  most commonly due to drug toxicity 
A long standing history of pruritus extending over months to years in a middle aged woman suggests primary biliary cirrhosis as the culprit 
However  pruritus may occasionally occur with viral hepatitis too 
Arthritis or urticaria appearing within a month of onset of jaundice and disappearing shortly before the onset points to hepatitis B virus infection Alpert et al 
Arthritis may also accompany or precede autoimmune hepatitis Golding et al 
True arthritis may also accompany hemochromatosis  although this disease rarely causes jaundice Bassett et al 
Bone pain simulating joint pain may accompany any long standing cholestatic condition due to vitamin D depletion and calcium deficiency 
The jaundiced patient requires thorough documentation of all recent drug and toxin exposures 
After asking for a list of the patient's drugs  the physician should specifically ask about pain relievers  tranquilizers  and birth control pills or other estrogens that the patient may forget to mention 
Chemicals  especially organic compounds used occupationally or at home  may be hepatotoxins 
Alcohol intake should be documented  preferably by estimating the number of grams or ounces of alcohol imbibed per day rather than the number of drinks consumed 
Alcohol abusers are often reluctant to tell the truth about their habit  and the physician may need to talk to the patient's spouse  other family members  or friends to obtain a complete picture 
Potential contact with hepatitis viruses and other infectious agents should also be determined 
This involves asking about contacts with other icteric or potentially hepatitic patients  recent transfusions  needle or narcotic use  and ingestion of raw shellfish 
Recent foreign travel to areas of poor sanitation carries a risk of exposure to hepatitis A virus or Entamoeba histolytica 
The homosexual male is at high risk for development of hepatitis A or B infection Keeffe 
Occupational exposure to barnyard animals  slaughterhouses  or stagnant water may implicate leptospirosis 
A patient who is immunologically compromised is a potential target for cytomegalovirus or herpes virus infection  while work in an institution i e   prison  day care center or health care facility may implicate hepatitis A or B virus infection 
A young icteric individual with a sore throat and rash may have infectious mononucleosis 
A patient with bacterial sepsis due to a wide variety of bacteria may have jaundice without cholangitis or biliary obstruction Gottlieb et al 
Surgical history  whether recent or remote may be implicated in the cause of jaundice Lamont and Isselbacher 
Within the first three postoperative weeks  jaundice may be due to a variety of problems that include   increased bilirubin load related to hemolysis of transfused erythrocytes especially stored blood  resorption of hematomas or hemoperitoneum and rarely to hemolysis of the patient's erythrocytes due to G PD deficiency  drug reactions or malarial parasites in transfused blood   impaired hepatocellular function  which may be related to administration of halogenated anesthesia agents  exposure to other hepatotoxic drugs  sepsis  or hepatic ischemia associated with preoperative or intraoperative hypotension or hypoxia  and  extrahepatic biliary obstruction  which may be secondary to inadvertent surgical injury to the common bile duct or occasionally to an unsuspected biliary calculus or to cholecystitis 
Biliary tract surgery in the remote past may have produced a biliary stricture  although these are usually clinically evident within  years of operation 
When investigating a case of jaundice potentially related to surgery  it is important to examine the operative record for transfusion  anesthesia  x rays  drugs  and potential hypotension or hypoxia  as well as the surgeon's dictated note of intraoperative events and his visual and palpation impression of the patient's liver  biliary tree  and pancreas 
Other systemic conditions may have complications related to the liver 
For example  patients with inflammatory bowel disease are predisposed to primary sclerosing cholangitis  cholangiocarcinoma  chronic hepatitis  cirrhosis  and hepatic amyloid 
If a significant section of terminal ileum has been involved by or resected for Crohn's disease  the patient may also have gallstones Allan    Warren and Kern 
Cystic fibrosis  hemochromatosis  Wilson's disease  alpha  antitrypsin deficiency and other hereditary metabolic diseases with prominent hepatic effects i e   galactosemia  hereditary fructose intolerance  and tyrosinemia all may be complicated by cirrhosis Alagille and Odievre 
Systemic lupus erythematosus sometimes directly affects the liver Runyon  LaBrecque  and Anuras 
Acutely or subacutely decreased hepatic oxygenation of any cause may simulate the hepatic manifestations of viral hepatitis 
A family history of jaundice  liver disease  or anemia especially when requiring splenectomy should be sought 
A positive family history of liver disease may implicate the genetically transmitted nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemias i e   Crigler Najjar  Gilbert's  Dubin Johnson  or Rotor's syndromes  benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis  Wilson's disease  hemochromatosis  alpha  antitrypsin deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis in the differential diagnosis 
In most instances  physical examination of the jaundiced patient confirms a diagnosis suspected by history or provides diagnostic proof in its own right 
A general examination of the patient furnishes numerous diagnostic clues 
At any given level of jaundice  the patient with hepatocellular disease appears more acutely ill than the individual with obstruction 
Indeed  unless his course is complicated by cholangitis  the obstructed patient generally does not appear acutely ill at all 
The patient's age renders some diagnoses more likely than others 
Carcinoma of the pancreas is an increasingly prominent cause of jaundice over  years of age 
The incidence of hepatitis A virus is greatest in youth  but hepatitis B and non A  non B virus infections may occur at any age 
Gallstones may uncommonly occur in adolescence but become increasingly common in middle age 
A green cast to the jaundice indicates prolonged obstruction  while an orange yellow color is more compatible with a hepatocellular mechanism 
Disorientation  obtundation  or a simple slowing of mental processes such as speech or recall incriminate disturbed hepatocellular function rather than obstruction as a cause of jaundice 
Examination of the skin may reveal bruising resulting from disturbed blood coagulation mechanisms 
Spider telangiectases are small cutaneous arteriovenous anastomoses that blanch when pressure is exerted on the central point of the vascular complex 
They are most liable to appear on the upper body including trunk  arms  hands  neck  and face 
Although they may occasionally occur singly in normal people and more commonly during pregnancy  their presence generally indicates chronic hepatocellular disease 
Scratch marks confirm a patient's history of pruritus 
Decreased axillary and pubic hair and a change from a male to female escutcheon over the genitals suggests cirrhosis 
Dupuytren's contracture may also accompany chronic liver disease 
Xanthelasma and tuberous xanthomas are fatty deposits appearing on eyelids and over the buttock and extensor surfaces of the extremities respectively and are commonly seen in long standing biliary obstruction with hyperlipidemia  especially primary biliary cirrhosis 
Auscultation over the liver including the lower right anterior chest should be performed prior to manual manipulation of the area 
Although abdominal bruits may be found in up to  of normal people Babb    hepatic bruits  especially those of a harsh quality  are often associated with hepatic malignancy  alcoholic hepatitis  or occasionally with hemangiornas or other vascular lesions 
Hepatic friction rubs are usually due to malignancy or inflammatory disease involving Glisson's capsule Simpson 
Abnormal auscultatory sounds may be better appreciated with the patient standing rather than recumbent 
Palpation of the liver is the single most crucial step in evaluation of the jaundiced patient 
An appreciation of its size  surface characteristics  and tenderness are central to understanding the cause of the patient's illness 
Liver size should always be expressed in terms of centimeters of total span 
This involves determining the position of the lower hepatic border by palpation  percussion  or ballotment and that of the upper border by percussion and measuring the distance between the two marks 
Liver span is dependent on the height and lean body mass of the patient and especially on the percussion technique of the examiner Castell et al 
However  a normal liver span does not guarantee that the organ is functionally or histologically normal 
Observer variation regarding liver size can usually be resolved with an objective measurement such as a liver scan 
Very large livers are likely to be congested or fatty or to be involved with cirrhosis  neoplasm  or amyloid 
A rapidly shrinking liver combined with deepening jaundice and clinical deterioration indicates acute liver failure  usually secondary to a virus or toxin 
A hard or nodular liver is probably fibrotic or infiltrated with tumor 
Although the normal liver is slightly tender to palpation  unusual hepatic tenderness is often the result of acute hepatitis of any cause  abscess  or rapid hepatic enlargement secondary to vascular congestion or fatty infiltration 
Splenomegaly is frequently found in the jaundiced patient  although its specific etiology is variable 
Splenomegaly without hepatomegaly may result from primary hemolytic disease especially hereditary spherocytosis or from portal vein occlusion of any cause 
Enlarged spleens commonly result from portal hypertension caused by liver disease or hepatic venous obstruction 
In these instances  hypersplenism with hemolysis may contribute to the patient's jaundice 
Splenomegaly due to portal hypertension is often associated with ascites and  in later stages  a prominent abdominal venous pattern 
An enlarged spleen may also occur in viral hepatitis as a nonspecific reticuloendothelial response to infection 
Finally  concurrent hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may not be related as cause and effect  but both may be due to involvement by another process  most commonly tumor particularly hematologic or storage disease 
Ascites in the jaundiced patient is an ominous sign  usually signifying severly decompensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension or malignancy studding the peritoneum or invading the liver 
Occasionally  ascites may be due to massive or subacute hepatic necrosis or hepatic vein obstruction  but is a rare feature of isolated portal vein occlusion 
Bilateral lower extremity edema often accompanies ascites  although the latter frequently occurs without evidence of other fluid accumulation 
If bilaterally equal leg edema arises in a jaundiced patient who does not have ascites or cardiovascular renal disease  carcinoma of the pancreas with inferior vena cava obstruction must be considered 
An abdominal venous pattern extending over the anterior abdominal wall in a patient with ascites usually means that the patient has portal hypertension 
Occasionally it can indicate an obstruction of the inferior vena cava with collateral flow Missal et al 
If the venous pattern is secondary to portal hypertension  blood in the vessels will flow away from the umbilicus 
If the patient has caval obstruction  blood in the dilated veins will flow superiorly at all levels 
An everted umbilicus in a patient with massive ascites indicates chronic abdominal distention and usually means cirrhosis 
Dark urine resembling tea  which develops a green foam on shaking  is caused by bile pigment 
Its presence excludes hemolysis or a hepatic uptake or conjugating defect of bilirubin metabolism acting alone as a cause of jaundice 
The stool of patients whose jaundice is due to hemolysis is brown 
Patients with mild to moderate hepatocellular jaundice also have brown stools  although as their hepatic excretory ability increasingly fails  their stool may turn a clay color 
Patients with obstructive jaundice often have clay colored stools 
A jaundiced patient with a positive reaction for blood in a clay colored stool suggests carcinoma of the pancreas or ampulla of Vater 
Laboratory tests usually serve to confirm the pathophysiology of jaundice 
Sometimes they may demonstrate a specific etiology as well Chopra and Griffin 
The complete blood count may provide evidence for hemolysis by demonstrating anemia in a patient without blood loss or a blood smear with spherocytes or other oddly shaped erythrocytes 
Hemolysis may be proven via a reticulocyte count  Coomb's test  or other specific tests of erythrocyte enzymes 
Leukocytosis and neutrophilia are unusual in viral hepatitis  although common in cholangitis and alcoholic hepatitis 
Eosinophilia plus jaundice is suspicious for toxic hepatitis on a basis of hypersensitivity 
A jaundiced patient without urinary bilirubin has either hemolysis or a hepatic defect in bilirubin uptake or conjugation 
Marked persistent proteinuria in a jaundiced patient is suspicious for amyloid 
Liver function tests are nonspecific indicators of liver disease 
None of them alone provides a sensitive evaluation of liver function 
Many of the enzymes tested have potential sources other than the liver 
Their interpretation is possible only in the light of a thorough history and meticulous physical examination 
Even then  their value is often realized only alter serial determinations have been obtained 
Normal serum bilirubin concentration is usually no greater than 
mgdl and is composed primarily of the unconjugated form 
Jaundice due primarily to hemolysis or a bilirubin conjugation disorder results in a serum bilirubin whose unconjugated component is at least  of the total 
Moreover  in the presence of a normal liver  hemolysis alone does not produce a serum bilirubin greater than  mgdl Berk and Javitt 
A rise in serum bilirubin up to  mgdl per day is compatible with extrahepatic obstruction  but a greater rate of increase suggests hemolysis  hepatitis  or hepatic necrosis 
The serum bilirubin of patients with pure biliary obstruction generally does not exceed  mgdl  a greater value indicates that a component of hepatocellular jaundice is present as well 
Serum alkaline phosphatase derives from liver  bone  placenta  intestinal mucosa  and certain tumors 
In most instancies  only sources from liver and bone are clinically important 
Alkaline phosphatase is often elevated to at least three times the upper limit of normal in patients with jaundice due to intra  or extrahepatic obstruction but is usually less than this figure in hepatocellular jaundice 
However  patients with acute alcoholic liver disease may have alkaline phosphatase elevations higher than five times the upper limit of normal without an obstructive component 
The enzyme is also frequently elevated in diffuse hepatic infiltration i e   tumor  granulomas 
An alkaline phosphatase elevated out of proportion to serum bilirubin may mean hepatic infiltrative disease or partial biliary obstruction associated with choledochohthiasis 
biliary stricture  chronic pancreatitis  or with malignancy involving only one of the hepatic ducts 
In jaundiced women with a long history of hyperphosphalasia and pruritus  a diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis is likely Tornay 
This is confirmed by an antimitochondrial antibody test that is positive in approximately  of patients with this condition Klatskin and Kantor 
Although the test is not specific for primary biliary cirrhosis  it is almost always negative in extrahepatic obstruction  the most important differential diagnostic problem of this disease 
Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase  leucine aminopeptidase and  nucleotidase  serum hepatic enzymes used to determine the origin of an isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation  are not useful in the jaundiced patient because the source of the alkaline phosphatase is then obvious 
Transaminases SGOT and SGPT are found primarily in liver  skeletal and cardiac muscle  and kidney Ticktin and Trujillo 
However  SGPT elevations are relatively more specific for liver disease than those of SGOT Chopra and Griffin    Ticktin and Trujillo 
Transaminase elevations are common in both hepatocellular and obstructive jaundice  although higher values are generally achieved in the former case 
Unexpectedly elevated transaminases due to obstruction are caused by transient mechanisms such as floating gallstones or to sphincter of Oddi spasm 
In these instances  the transaminases fall rapidly toward normal over  hours 
Transaminase elevations associated with hepatocellular jaundice gradually decline over weeks 
Interestingly  the SGOT elevation in alcoholic hepatitis is uncommonly higher than   while the SGPT is almost always significantly lower than the SGOT 
In viral hepatitis both enzymes are often elevated to or higher than ten times the upper limit of normal  and the two are more nearly equal or the SGPT is frequently higher 
In general  transaminase elevations greater than  are usually due to viral or toxic hepatitis  decrease in hepatic oxygen supply i e   congestive heart failure  hypotension  or Reye's syndrome  and  uncommonly  to metastatic liver disease 
Prothrombin precursor is a protein manufactured by the liver whose full expression of activity in coagulation relies on a vitamin K dependent carboxylase Corrigan et al 
The concentrations of circulating prothrombin precursor and fully functional prothrombin may be measured independently 
Moderately severe hepatocellular disease results in reduction of both proteins  while extrahepatic obstruction  due to impairment of vitamin K absorption  will cause a fall of functional prothrombin alone 
Prognostically  a rise of the precursor concentration indicates return of hepatic synthetic capacity even though the patient's prothrombin time remains abnormal 
In practice  the prothrombin time may be prolonged more than  seconds over control in both hepatocellular and obstructive jaundice 
Parenteral administration of vitamin K  mg will correct the prothrombin time of the obstructed patient to normal within  hours  while that of the hepatocellular icteric patient will improve only partially or not at all 
A prothrombin time at least  seconds over control in a jaundiced patient and the inability to correct it with vitamin K is a poor prognostic sign 
Albumin is synthesized in the liver 
Because the protein has a relatively long half life approximately  weeks  its serum concentration will usually not fall significantly until liver disease has been present for at least  to  weeks 
However  elevated total serum globulins  especially when exhibiting a broad gamma electrophoretic distribution and when unexplained by other chronic inflammatory conditions  are a generally reliable indicator of chronic hepatocellular disease 
A serum protein electrophoretic pattern missing an alpha  peak suggests alpha  antitrypsin deficiency and should be followed by a specific assay for alpha  antitrypsin 
Serologic assays for hepatitis A and B viruses should be performed in cases of acutely developing jaundice 
Hepatitis A virus does not produce chronic liver disease  so only hepatitis B virus serology will be meaningful in patients with chronic hepatocellular disease Lemon    Friedman and Dienstag 
Antibody titers against delta agent  Epstein Barr virus  herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus  and urine culture for cytomegalovirus can also be obtained in selected cases 
In special cases  serological tests for leptospirosis  syphilis  and Entamoeba histolytica are also available 
Although a thorough history and physical examination still provide the best clinical diagnostic assessment of the jaundiced patient  new imaging procedures designed to identify biliary obstruction or other potential surgical causes of jaundice i e   multiple hepatic abscesses have proved invaluable 
In the past  to  years  the development of high resolution ultrasound and computerized tomography CT and advanced techniques and equipment for performing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography PTC  endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP  and hepatobiliary scintigraphy HBS have revolutionized the investigation of jaundice 
Imaging investigation should start with a chest x ray and plain film of the abdomen 
The former may furnish clues such as cardiac enlargement with pulmonary venous engorgement  mass lesion in the chest  bony erosion of the ribs and spine  pleural effusions  or an elevated right diaphragm 
The abdominal film may demonstrate hepatic or pancreatic calcifications or gallstones  approximately  to  of which are radiopaque 
Abdominal sonography is a valuable screening test in the jaundiced patient Ferruci    Meire 
The demonstration of biliary ductal dilation  gallstones  hepatic mass lesion  or an enlarged or abnormally shaped pancreas directs further investigation or therapy 
Sonography is noninvasive  readily available in most hospitals  does not involve radiation exposure  and is cheaper than CT or other procedures in which the bile ducts are directly opacified 
It may also allow guided biopsy or drainage of lesions in the liver or pancreas 
However  sonography may be technically unsatisfactory in up to  of cases  primarily due to obesity or to accumulation of bowel gas  which prevents transmission of sound waves 
Sonography is frequently more successful at identifying ductal dilation rather than its level or cause  but may also miss early cases of obstruction in which the biliary tree has not had sufficient opportunity to dilate 
Finally  the procedure may be difficult to perform in the postoperative patient with surgical wounds  dressings  and drains that prevent close apposition of the sonographic probe to the abdominal wall 
Nevertheless  in most patients sonography should be the initial imaging procedure directed at the biliary tree 
Computerized tomography has the advantage of surveying the entire abdomen as well as the hepatobiliary pancreatic axis Lee and Evens    Kreel 
In addition to reliably detecting ductal dilation  CT is superior to sonography in determining the level and cause of obstruction 
The pancreas is displayed more reliably and accurately by CT than by sonography 
The obese patient and patients with prior biliary enteric bypass procedures in whom the bile ducts may not be well seen sonographically might best be first examined by CT 
Like sonography  CT allows accurate guided biopsy or drainage of otherwise inaccessible lesions 
CT is technically unsatisfactory in only approximately  of cases 
It is expensive  however  involves radiation exposure  and is not available at some health care facilities 
Optimal interpretation of CT for the jaundiced patient often involves administration of intravenous or oral contrast to opacity the bile ducts and bowel repectively  some patients may not tolerate these agents due to drug allergy or to abdominal pain or ileus 
Residual intestinal barium may also prevent x ray transmission and create artifact 
Although CT usually defines an abnormally shaped pancreas with high accuracy  it may not always distinguish the cause of the misshapen gland i e   carcinoma versus chronic pancreatitis 
ERCP may then be necessary to complete the evaluation 
CT is particularly useful in patients with equivocal sonographic data or a strong suspicion of pancreatic disease or biliary obstruction despite negative sonography 
Patients with ductal dilation on sonography or CT whose cause is not identified should be investigated with either PTC or ERCP 
Until recently  hepatobiliary scintigraphy had little to contribute to the differential diagnosis of jaundice except in the instance of neonatal hepatitis versus biliary atresia or the occasional need for objective assessment of liver size 
However  the development of new radionuclide agents with improved hepatic extraction and biliary excretion  improved imaging techniques  and the application of computer assistance to interpretation of dynamic scans have transformed HBS into an accurate modality for the diagnosis of large bile duct obstruction and may also prove useful in demonstrating intrahepatic cholestasis Lieberman and Krishnamurthy 
The advantages of HBS include its safety  ready availability in standard nuclear medicine facilities  and its ability to visualize liver and bile ducts despite obesity  bowel gas  rib cage configuration  or serum bilirubin levels up to  mgdl Weissmann 
When evaluating the patency of the extrahepatic bile ducts by HBS  the scintigraphic image of the liver provides an added advantage to uncover unsuspected abscess or neoplasm 
HBS does not have the resolution needed to diagnose specifically gallstones or tumor in the biliary system 
Consequently  HBS  when used for uncovering extrahepatic obstruction  provides functional data i e   are the ducts normally patent 
but uncommonly furnishes anatomic data i e   cause of the obstruction 
However  because biliary obstruction may exist for several weeks before the proximal ducts dilate sufficiently to be visualized by ultrasound or CT  HBS may provide a more rapid assessment of biliary patency then is obtainable by other noninvasive means Kaplun et al 
Demonstration of intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction by HBS usually leads to investigation with CT  PTC  ERCP or needle liver biopsy  which usually supply the final diagnosis 
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography involves passage of a thin needle into the liver under fluoroscopic guidance and injection of contrast into the biliary tree Lintott 
The procedure is easily available  its cost is generally less than that of ERCP  and a local anesthetic injection over the right flank is the only sedative or anesthetic medication required 
Dilated ducts are opacified in  to  of cases  but even nondilated ducts are opacified in  to  of cases 
A dilated  obstructed duct may be decompressed percutaneously by passage of a guide wire and cannula through the right flank incision 
If the ducts are not visualized or if a nonobstructed biliary tree is found  one can immediately perform a needle liver biopsy through the anesthetized incision in the patient's right side 
The patient should have a normal clotting mechanism and intravenous antibiotics should be administered before the procedure to guard against cholangitis and septicemia should an obstruction be revealed 
PTC cannot visualize the pancreatic ductal system but can only show the effect of pancreatic compression on the distal common bile duct 
Thus  PTC cannot accurately distinguish between obstruction due to pancreatic carcinoma or chronic pancreatitis 
Patients allergic to ioditiated contrast agents should not undergo PTC 
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is performed by passing a flexible fiberoptic endoscope into the patient's duodenum  inserting a cannula into the pancreatic and common bile ducts and injecting radiopaque contrast into these structures under fluoroscopy Salmon 
ERCP has the advantage of visualization and potential biopsy of the stomach and duodenum since the scope is side viewing 
the esophagus cannot be seen 
The procedure diagnoses pancreatic carcinoma in at least  of cases and can furnish visual photographic and radiographic and histologic proof of ampullary tumors 
Cylologic smears may be obtained from juice aspirated from the pancreatic and bile ducts or from a brush inserted into these ducts 
Finally  the endoscope may be used to place biliary stents or to dissolve or physically remove gallstones from within the biliary tree 
However  the procedure is usually expensive and requires considerable endoscopic experience to master 
Sedative medications are necessary  prior antibiotics are advisable in cases of suspected ductal obstruction  allergic reactions to contrast may occur  and the patient is exposed to the infrequent but definite risks of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as the occasional risk of inducing cholangitis or clinical chemical pancreatitis 
The choice between PTC and ERCP is usually made according to the skill and experience of the operator 
Mesenteric arteriography has been supplanted in the investigation of jaundice by other procedures that can more accurately assess the liver and pancreas for neoplasm or inflammation 
Nevertheless  arteriography is still valuable to determine the operability of and surgical approach to a neoplasm or inflammatory mass by visualizing its vascular supply and adjacent vessels 
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is at least as sensitive as CT in detecting hepatic metastases and is much more sensitive than CT for this purpose when iodinated contrast cannot be used 
MRI is also highly reliable in distinguishing benign from malignant hepatic masses 
MRI is presently inferior to CT in pancreatic imaging 
At this time MRI has no place in imaging of the biliary tract Council on Scientific Affairs 
Percutaneous needle liver biopsy is a safe procedure in experienced hands provided that the patient's coagulation mechanism is normal Menghini 
Even if the clotting process is abnormal  a needle biopsy may be performed by correcting individual factor deficiencies i e   transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or platelets provided that the potential diagnosis obtained from the specimen warrants the risk 
The safety and diagnostic yield of the biopsy may also be increased by its performance via laparoscopy which allows for direct visualization of the liver and tamponade of a bleeding biopsy site Friedman and Wolff 
In the vast majority of instances  however  liver biopsy is an elective procedure that can wait until conditions are optimal 
With the advent of imaging procedures that can reliably identify extrahepatic obstruction in almost  of instances and with the ease of diagnosing many acute and chronic hepatocellular diseases by clinical  biochemical  and serologic means  needle liver biopsy is primarily useful in the jaundiced patient today to   follow chronic liver disease to determine progression of the natural process or the effects of therapy   determine the cause of hepatomegaly   distinguish between intrahepatic and extrahepatic obstruction patients with drug induced jaundice  primary biliary cirrhosis  and intrahepatic neoplasm may present with jaundice and defy diagnosis until liver tissue is obtained  and  provide liver tissue for special investigations such as culture  enzyme assay i e   glycogen storage disease  chemical analysis i e   hemochromatosis  Wilson's disease or immunologic studies i e   hepatitis B virus  delta agent 
A normal or nondiagnostic percutaneous needle liver biopsy in a jaundiced patient who has already had negative imaging procedures for extrahepatic obstruction is an indication for laparoscopy and liver biopsy by direct visualization

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme metabolism Bissell    Billing 
Heme is an iron containing porphyrin found in hemoglobin  myoglobin  and several enzymes of which the hepatic cytochromes are the most important representatives 
Approximately  of daily bilirubin production derives from senescent red blood cells 
These are broken down in the reticuloendothelial systems of spleen  liver  and marrow where iron is removed from the heme molecule and the remaining porphyrin ring is oxidized and cleaved at a single site to form the tetrapyrrole chain structure of biliverdin 
Further reduction of biliverdin results in the formation of bilirubin 
Up to  of normal bililrubin production may derive from degradation of non hemoglobin heme containing hepatic enzymes or from erythrocytes that never reached the circulation but were destroyed in situ ineffective erythropoiesis 
This fraction is called early labeled bilirubin ELB because injection of isotopically labeled glycine appears as this bilirubin fraction within  hours  while bilirubin produced from circulating old erythrocytes appears  to  days after injection Robinson et al 
The ELB fraction enlarges with marked ineffective erythropoiesis that occurs in pernicious anemia  thalassemia  and sideroblastic anemia and in primary shunt hyperbilirubinemia  a rare condition in which erythroid hyperplasia  reticulocytosis  splenomegaly  and normal peripheral red blood cell survival coexist 
Unconjugated bilirubin has limited aqueous solubility and is therefore transported from the reticuloendothelial system cells to the liver reversibly bound to albumin 
Bilirubin may be displaced from albumin by conditions predisposing to acidosis and hypoxia and by certain drugs  most notably salicylates and sulfonamides 
High plasma levels of free fatty acids may also displace bilirubin from its protein binding sites 
Circulating unconjugated bilirubin is chemically identified as the indirect fraction in the Van den Bergh reaction 
Within the liver  bilirubin dissociates from albumin at the hepatocyte membrane and is transported into the hepatocyte 
Although the hepatic uptake potential of bilirubin is rarely utilized to capacity and is therefore not a rate limiting step in its elimination  reduced hepatic sinusoidal flow can limit the removal of bilirubin from the circulation and contribute to clinical jaundice 
Patients with Gilbert's syndrome see below may also have a component of impaired bilirubin uptake 
The pathway of hepatic bilirubin uptake is shared by bromsulphthalein BSP and indocyanine green ICG but not by bile acids 
Within the cytosol  bilirubin binds to the Y ligand and Z proteins and is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where bilirubin conjugation occurs 
Unconjugated bilirubin is loosely bound to the Y and Z proteins  under normal circumstances  up to  of bilirubin attached to these proteins may reflux back into the plasma 
There are no well defined circumstances in which impaired hepatic intracellular binding of bilirubin contributes to jaundice 
Excretion of bilirubin into bile requires its conversion into a more hydrophilic molecule 
This is accomplished by the microsomal enzyme bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase UDPGT which  in its monomeric form  conjugates bilirubin with a single molecule of glucuronic acid to produce bilirubin monoglucuronide BMG 
However  in its tetramer state  UDPGT catalyzes production of bilirubin diglucuronide BDG Peters and Jansen    which accounts for  of bilirubin in bile 
All forms of conjugated bilirubin are identified as the direct fraction in the Van den Bergh reaction 
The conjugation process is impaired in Gilbert's and Crigler Najjar syndromes and in neonatal processes such as breast milk jaundice  the Lucey Driscoll syndrome  congenital hypothyroidism  and high intestinal obstruction Andres et al 
In the last instance  the cause of decreased bilirubin conjugation is unknown but it is relieved following surgical correction of the obstruction 
Conjugating ability is usually preserved even in severe hepatic inflammatory disease but is decreased during fulminant hepatic failure 
Following conjugation  bilirubin is transported to the bile canaliculus by an unknown carrier mediated mechanism that it shares with other organic anions including BSP  ICG  and cholecystographic dyes  but not with bile acids 
However  taurocholate can increase biliary excretion of bilirubin  possibly by incorporating the pigment into mixed micelles 
Under normal circumstances  canalicular excretion of bilirubin is the rate limiting step of bilirubin elimination 
Thus  diseases that affect the liver and cause jaundice usually produce a disproportionate rise of the conjugated fraction 
Impaired canalicular transport results in regurgitation of conjugated bilirubin into plasma where it circulates attached to albumin 
The small unbound fraction of conjugated bilirubin is available for renal excretion which  under normal conditions  is a quantitatively insignificant mode of pigment removal 
As the plasma content of conjugated bilirubin rises  whether due to hepatocellular or obstructive disease  an increasingly large percentage of available bilirubin becomes strongly covalently bound to albumin Weiss et al 
As the patient's liver recovers or the obstructive process is relieved  the fraction of conjugated bilirubin that is either loosely bound or unbound to albumin is rapidly cleared from the blood 
However  the protein bound molecule is cleared slowly in accordance with the  week half life of the albumin molecule 
This accounts for the slow fall in bilirubin levels as inflammation or obstruction subsides and also accounts for the absence of urinary bilirubin in the presence of abnormal plasma levels because the protein bound pigment is not filtered by the glomerulus 
Canalicular excretion of bilirubin is impaired in patients with drug induced cholestasis  decreased hepatic oxygenation  acute infection i e   bacterial sepsis  viral hepatitis  toxoplasmosis  syphilis  metabolic diseases i e   galactosemia  hereditary fructose intolerance  tyrosinemia or genetic diseases of unknown etiology i e   benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis  Byler's disease  Dubin Johnson and Rotor's syndromes 
Ductular low may be decreased by portal inflammatory processes such as primary biliary cirrhosis  sarcoidosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis or by other processes such as paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts 
Ductal excretion is impaired by carcinoma  gallstones or non neoplastic stricture induced by surgery  chronic pancreatitis or primary sclerosing cholangilis but also by conditions favoring stasis such as choledochal cyst or Caroli's disease 
The complexities of bilirubin metabolism and the varied influences impinging on each step of bilirubin excretion often combine to produce multiple causes of jaundice for any given disease process 
For example  cirrhosis may produce excess unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia by favoring erythrocyte destruction via hypersplenism and by reducing hepatic uptake of pigment via rearrangement of vascular channels but may also increase the conjugated fraction by decreasing canalicular excretion or ductular flow or by favoring gallstone production  of patients with cirrhosis have gallstones and possible choledocholithiasis 
Massive blood loss into soft tissues or the retroperitoneal space may favor excess bilirubin production  decreased bilirubin extraction through diminished hepatic blood flow  and decreased canalicular excretion by causing hepatic ischemia 
There are several chronic hyperbilirubinemic conditions Crigler Najjar syndrome types I and II  Gilbert's syndrome  Dubin Johnson syndrome  Rotor's syndrome that have in common genetic transmission  normality of standard liver function tests other than serum bilirubin  normal liver architecture  and  in most cases  absence of associated morbidity and mortality Bissell    Berthelot and Dhumeaux 
These conditions are genetically heterogeneous  families have been described in which Gilbert's syndrome predominates but Dubin Johnson patients appear too  or in which Crigler Najjar type II predominates but Gilbert's syndrome also occurs 
Moreover  these entities may not necessarily be pathophysiologically distinct 
Although patient's with Gilbert's syndrome have an isolated bilirubin conjugationuptake defect  some may also be unable to eliminate ICG or ICG and BSP as well 
Gilbert's syndrome may actually represent several entities whose cause may range from decreased bilirubin uptake to decreased bilirubin glucuronidation 
However  it is manifest by a total serum bilirubin up to but no greater than  mgdl  more than  of which is in the unconjugated form 
Serum bilirubin in these patients is increased by fasting for up to  hours  but the mechanism for this phenomenon is not clear 
Liver morphology is typically normal 
Gilbert's syndrome does not produce symptoms or adverse effects and is associated with a normal life span 
Indeed  up to  of an unselected population may have a decreased ability to dispose of injected radioactive bilirubin 
Treatment of Gilbert's syndrome is unnecessary  although phenobarbital can lower serum bilirubin in many patients  presumably because of its ability to induce microsomal enzymes UDPGT 
Gilbert's syndrome is probably transmitted as an autosomal dominant gene with incomplete penetrance 
The rare Crigler Najjar syndrome is due to either partial or total deficiency of UDPGT 
Type I  representing total enzymatic deficiency and probably transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene  is fatal in early life due to development of kernicterus 
Bilirubin levels are typically greater than  mgdl and are totally unconjugated  the patient's bile is colorless 
Phenobarbital and other microsomal enzyme inducers are ineffective 
Type II  a partial enzymatic deficiency  typically produces serum bilirubin levels between  and  mgdl 
It is probably transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with incomplete penetrance and is compatible with a normal life span 
Phenobarbital can decrease serum bilirubin by enzymatic induction of UDPGT 
Dubin Johnson syndrome  a disorder characterized by increased conjugated and unconjugated serum bilirubin and transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene  is due to inability of the hepatocyte to excrete conjugated bilirubin into the canaliculus 
These patients are also unable to excrete BSP  ICG or cholecystographic dyes  although their serum bile acids are normal 
Their hepatic architecture is normal but there is an accumulation of hepatic pigment compatible with melanin 
Serum bilirubin levels are usually no greater than  mgdl  although levels higher than  mgdl have been reported 
Dubin Johnson syndrome is sometimes unmasked during pregnancy or by use of estrogens  which impairs canalicular excretion of bilirubin 
The healthy patient with long standing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia  other normal liver function tests  and a nonvisualized gallbladder should be suspect for Dubin Johnson syndrome  and the gallbladder should be analyzed sonographically before considering surgery 
BSP  mgkg injected intravenously produces a characteristic finding in which a blood sample drawn  to  minutes after injection has a higher BSP concentration than a sample taken  minutes after injection whether the BSP concentration in the latter is normal or elevated 
The condition is asymptomatic and compatible with a normal life span 
Rotor's syndrome is a harmless chronic hyperbilirubinemia transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene in which the serum bilirubin is usually less than  mgdl and equally split between conjugated and unconjugated fractions 
Other liver function tests are normal 
Like Dubin Johnson syndrome  the Rotor's syndrome patient has an impairment of BSP and ICG elimination 
However  in Rotor's syndrome the storage capacity of the hepatocyte for bilirubin is markedly decreased  while in Dubin Johnson syndrome the excretory defect is primarily due to decreased transport of bilirubin into the canaliculus 
In Rotor's syndrome the gallbladder opacifies normally with cholecystographic dye and the liver is not pigmented 
Rotor's and Dubin Johnson syndrome can be further distinguished because urinary coproporphyrin studies in the former show elevated total coproporphyrin excretion due to an increase in both the coproporphyrin I and III isomers  while studies in the latter show normal total coproporphyrin excretion with a large relative increase of the coproporphyrin I isomer Wolkoff et al

The most important question to answer in the evaluation of any jaundiced patient is  Will this patient require surgery to relieve biliary obstruction 
In most patients  the answer is reasonably straightforward  but in some  this problem may tax the diagnostic skills of the finest clinician 
Surgical relief of jaundice will be indicated almost exclusively for obstructive problems situated at or distal to the porta hepatis and only occasionally for patients with intrahepatic abscesses or other nonmalignant intrahepatic space occupying lesions 
Some extrahepatic obstructive conditions  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis  may not be amenable to surgical correction 
The icteric patient with extrahepatic obstruction due to gallstones or postsurgical biliary stricture has usually had acute symptoms for less than  weeks  while those with pancreatic or biliary ductal carcinoma  chronic pancreatitis  or primary sclerosing cholangitis have had symptoms of longer duration 
A prominent history of recent weight loss suggests malignancy  while fever and chills suggest cholangitis 
Intermittent right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back or right shoulder favors gallstones  while constant epigastric or right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back suggests malignancy 
Past biliary tract surgery  especially within  years of the patient's presentation  should alert the physician to possible biliary stricture 
On physical examination  the obstructed patient appears icteric but not acutely ill unless septic 
Liver size is either normal or slightly enlarged  while the spleen is usually not palpable 
Ascites may be present if a malignancy obstructing the biliary tree has also invaded the liver or parietal peritoneum 
On laboratory examination  the patient with extrahepatic obstruction and jaundice has a bilirubin equal to or less than  mgdl  if the bilirubin is higher than  mgdl  the jaundice also has a hepatocellular component 
At least  of the serum bilirubin of obstructed patients is in the conjugated form 
The serum alkaline phosphatase level is often three times the upper limit of normal or higher while transaminases are either normal or only mildly elevated 
The prothrombin time may be prolonged but corrects easily to normal with parenteral vitamin K 
Globulins are usually normal although serum albumin may be decreased if the patient has suffered recent weight loss 
Patients with jaundice due to intrahepatic problems may have had symptoms for less than  weeks i e   acute hepatitis of any cause or more than  weeks i e   cirrhosis  chronic hepatitis  familial liver conditions 
Abdominal pain often plays a minor role in the patient's history  while the major complaints are usually malaise  fatigue  and other constitutional symptoms 
The history may reveal exposure to hepatotoxins especially alcohol or other drugs  recent contact with other similarly ill patients or sources of viral exposure i e   needles  transfusions  sexual contacts  unsanitary environment  decreased hepatic blood flow or hypoxemia  or familial liver disease 
On physical examination  the icteric patient with hepatocellular disease often appears acutely or chronically ill  sometimes both 
However  patients with hereditary chronic hyperbilirubinemias Gilbert's  Crigler Najjar  Dubin Johnson or Rotor's syndromes appear completely well 
The icteric patient with hepatocellular disease often has an enlarged liver  which  in the case of viral or bacterial infection  is frequently tender 
Splenomegaly is often present  whether secondary to portal hypertension  reaction to infection or occasionally to primary hematologic malignancy 
Spider telangiectases are common in patients with chronic liver disease of any cause 
Ascites is frequently associated with hepatic malignancy or chronic liver disease  especially cirrhosis 
Laboratory examination of patients with hepatocellular disease is highly variable 
Serum bilirubin may range from slightly greater than normal to more than  mgdl and may be composed almost exclusively of the unconjugated or predominently of the conjugated form 
Serum alkaline phosphatase is often less than twice the upper limit of normal but may be particularly elevated in primary biliary cirrhosis  granulomatous hepatitis  intrahepatic cholestasis  acute alcoholic liver disease or infiltrative or space occupying lesions 
Transaminase elevations greater than  are typical of hepatocellular disease 
An elevated prothrombin time that does not correct to normal with parenteral vitamin K indicates hepatocellular disease 
The jaundiced patient with elevated globulins often has chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis 
From a diagnostic standpoint  sonography of the liver  biliary tree  and pancreas should be the first specific imaging screening test 
If biliary dilation is present  the patient should have either PTC or ERCP 
If sonography is equivocal or if the sonogram is interpreted as normal but there is a strong clinical suspicion of biliary obstruction  CT or HBS should be performed 
PTC or ERCP may provide more definitive anatomic diagnosis of the site and nature of an obstructive process than is available by the noninvasive imaging procedures 
If there is no imaging evidence of obstruction and hepatocellular disease is suspected  a needle liver biopsy is indicated 
If the needle liver biopsy is normal or equivocal  laparoscopy with liver biopsy under direct visual guidance may prove diagnostic
