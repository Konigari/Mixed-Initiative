A cough is a sudden  usually involuntary  expulsion of air from the lungs with a characteristic and easily recognizable sound 
Although it is known as the most common symptom of respiratory disorders  it serves the functions of defending the respiratory tract against noxious substances and maintaining airway patency by removing excessive secretions from the air passages 
Expectoration or sputum production is the act of coughing up and spitting out the material produced in the respiratory tract 
==========
A careful history  the most helpful task in the evaluation of patients with cough  will suggest the diagnosis of its cause in most instances 
If the cough is not a part of the patient's presenting symptoms  its presence or absence should be determined by pointed questions not only directed to the patient but also to the spouse or other family members  as the patient may be unaware of a cough or may underestimate its frequency and duration 
For example  it is not uncommon for patients with chronic bronchitis to be oblivious to their frequent coughing  while people around them are quite annoyed by it 
Some patients may perceive their cough as throat clearing 
Many times  the truth about the patient's cough reveals itself to the observer during the interview and physical examination 
Once it is acknowledged that the patient has a cough  adequate information about its characteristics and circumstances should be obtained by appropriate questioning 
  Was the onset of the cough sudden or insidious 
What was its initiating event 
Did it start as an isolated symptom or occur with or follow other symptoms 
 How long has the cough been present 
Is it persistent or episodic 
Seasonal or perennial 
 To determine the severity of the cough  ask  How frequent is a coughing spell 
How long does each coughing spell last 
What is its effect on daily activity or rest 
 Is the cough productive or dry 
Lack of expectoration does not necessarily indicate that the cough is dry  as many patients  particularly children and women  tend to swallow their sputum raised to the level of the pharynx 
The sound of the cough would help in determining its productive or dry nature 
Patients with sputum production should be asked about its frequency and description of the physical characteristics of the sputum including the amount with each coughing spell and daily total  color  consistency  ease of its expectoration  taste  and smell 
 Is the cough the only symptom  or is it associated with other respiratory or nonrespiratory symptoms 
Inquiry should be specifically made about conditions known to cause the cough  particularly when it is chronic and persistent 
 In addition to an accurate smoking history see Chapter   ask  To what respiratory irritants is the patient exposed at home or at work 
Is exposure accidental or intentional 
 What are the precipitating or aggravating factors 
What time of the day or night is the cough or sputum production worse 
Does it happen in supine position  upon arising in the morning  with drinking or eating  with exercise  or with breathing cold or dry air 
Does the cough awaken the patient from sleep 
 Is there a past history recent or old of foreign body aspiration 
 Has the pattern of the cough and the amount or other characteristics of the sputum changed recently 
 Can the patient locate the site of origin of the cough or the sputum  such as from the throat or deeper in the chest 
 Has the patient had a similar problem with coughing in the past 
 Does the cough have easily recognizable characteristics  as in croup or whooping cough?

The dynamic effect of a cough is the creation of an airflow velocity  within a certain portion of the airway  intense enough to shear and dislodge the secretions accumulated on the mucosal surface 
Although coughing may be entirely voluntary  it is usually a physiologic reflex 
As such  it is mediated through a reflex arc made of sensory receptors  afferent nerve fibers  a center  efferent nerve fibers  and effector muscles 
Cough receptors are considered to be the rapidly adapting nerve endings  which are also known as irritant receptors 
These nerve endings are more plentiful in the mucosa of the larynx  carina  trachea  and large bronchi  which are readily stimulated by mechanical or chemical irritants 
These are the portions of the airways in which the cough is most effective in clearing the secretions 
The cough receptors have also been demonstrated or suspected in other sites  including the pharynx  peripheral airways  and other intra  or extrathoracic sites such as pleura  ear canals  tympanic membrane  and even the stomach 
The vagus is the most important afferent nerve  although the glossopharyngeal and trigeminal nerves may operate  depending on the receptors involved 
A medullary cough center has been postulated with no proof of its precise anatomic location 
This center is under the influence of the higher voluntary nerve centers  which may initiate or modify the cough 
The efferent nerves are the vagi recurrent laryngeals  the phrenic nerves  and the spinal motor nerves of the expiratory muscles 
The mechanical events involved in a typical cough are rapid successions of   a fairly deep initial inspiration   the tight closure of the glottis  reinforced by the supraglottic structures   the quick and forceful contraction of the expiratory muscles  and  the sudden opening of the glottis while the contraction of the expiratory muscles continues 
The very high intrapulmonary pressure generated during the last two phases results in a very rapid airflow from the lungs once the glottis is open 
In addition  the pressure difference between the outside and the inside of the intrathoracic airways during phase  causes their dynamic compression and narrowing 
The combination of a high airflow and airway narrowing results in the expulsion of an airstream with a linear velocity sometimes nearing the speed of sound 
The blast of air thus produced is capable of expelling the secretions with a great force 
The site and the extent of the dynamic compression are determined by the lung volumes 
With large lung volumes  only the trachea and large bronchi are compressed  with smaller lung volumes  more distal airways are also narrowed 
With each successive cough without an intervening inspiration  as seen in patients with chronic bronchitis  lung volumes become smaller  and the cough becomes effective also in removing secretions from more distal airways 
With the ensuing deep inspiration  the cough restarts with larger lung volumes  and the cycle repeats itself 
The characteristic explosive sound of coughing results from the vibrations of the vocal cords  mucosal folds above and below the glottis  and the accumulated secretions 
Variation in sounds of coughing is due to several factors  including the nature and quantity of secretions  anatomic differences and pathologic change of the larynx and other air passages  and the force of the cough 
Vibrations of coughing also help in dislodging secretions from the airway walls 
The small amounts of tracheobronchial secretions normally produced are very effectively handled by the mucociliary clearance mechanism 
These secretions are made up of water  dialyzable substances such as electrolytes and glucose  mucus glycoprotein  indigenous and transudated proteins  and lipids surfactant 
The mucous glands and goblet cells are the primary sources of the tracheobronchial mucus 
By forming a thin blanket  the airway mucus covers the ciliated epithelium 
Rhythmic vibrations of cilia propel it toward the pharynx from where it is swallowed  usually unnoticed 
A proper balance between its formation and its clearance maintains a thin protective layer of mucus for trapping and removing the impurities of the inspired air while preventing the excessive accumulation of secretions 
With an adequate function of the mucociliary escalator  the cough has no additional benefit in removing the amount of secretions formed under normal conditions 
In pathologic states  however  when the mucociliary function is ineffective or insufficient because of the quantity or alteration of the physical properties of secretions  the cough becomes essential for airway clearance 
Although coughing is most effective when the excessive secretions are accumulated in the large  centrally located airways  it also plays an important role in clearing the peripheral airways in situations in which there is impaired mucociliary clearance  as in chronic bronchitis  cystic fibrosis  or primary ciliary dyskinesia immotile cilia syndrome 
A milking effect of coughing on peripheral airways has been suggested as a mechanism of its action in removing secretions from these sites 
This requires coughing at low lung volumes when the secretions are squeezed out of the small airways toward more centrally located bronchi 
In addition to the mucus  the expectorated sputum may contain other endogenous or exogenous materials  including transudated or exudated fluids  various local or migrated cells  microorganisms  necrotic tissues or cells  aspirated vomitus  or other foreign particles 
Gross appearance and other physical characteristics of the sputum are the result of its content of these and other materials 
Mucous sputum is clear or translucent and viscous  containing only small numbers of microscopic elements 
Purulent sputum is off white  yellow or green  and opaque 
It indicates the presence of large numbers of white blood cells  especially neutrophilic granulocytes 
In asthmatics  the sputum may look purulent from the eosinophilic cells 
Red coloration  uniform or streaky  is usually due to its mixture with blood 
Carbon particles discolor the sputum gray as in cigarette smokers or black as in coal miners or with smoke inhalation

As a cardinal manifestation of respiratory diseases  coughing is one of the most common symptoms encountered in clinical medicine 
Being a physiologic reflex  the cough also occurs without any demonstrable evidence of disease when triggered by the stimulation of the irritant receptors 
Moreover  it may be a voluntary act or may result from nervous habit 
Although the clinical significance of coughing in many instances is trivial  it may be an indication of a serious intrathoracic disease 
Pathologic conditions causing the cough are usually the ones that irritate the airways  increase their irritability  result in their deformation  or increase the tracheobronchial secretions 
These factors may operate singly or in various combinations 
Sputum production with coughing occurs when the respiratory tract secretions are beyond the ability of the mucociliary mechanism to deal with them 
The most common cause of the acute cough of clinical significance is viral tracheobronchitis 
The cough in this transient and self limited condition is  at the beginning  nonproductive and quite annoying  later it becomes productive of mucous or mucopurulent sputum before it begins to subside 
Inflammation of the respiratory tract mucosa  from infectious or noninfectious causes  results in hyper reactivity of the cough receptors 
This results from the alteration of the surface epithelium  making them more sensitive to the cough producing effect of commonly occurring mild irritants such as cold air  respiratory pollutants  deep or fast respiration  and excessive use of the larynx 
At times  the mechanical irritation of coughing itself brings about more coughing 
Inflammation  in addition  increases the secretions 
In acute viral respiratory tract infection  post nasal drip may be another cause for triggering the cough 
Other infectious  as well as noninfectious  diseases of upper or lower respiratory tract are known for their propensity in causing the cough as a part of their clinical manifestations Table 
A chronic cough  defined as a cough lasting for a minimum duration of  weeks  is usually indicative of structural changes in the respiratory tract or the persistence of other cough stimulating factors 
By far the most common cause of a chronic cough in developed nations is tobacco smoking  which is the most important factor in the etiology of chronic bronchitis 
In this disease  the cough is productive of a fairly large amount of sputum that varies from mucous to mucopurulent 
Patients with chronic bronchitis  well accustomed and often oblivious to their symptoms  become concerned when the characteristics of their cough and sputum production change 
The most frequent cause for the change is the intercurrence of an infection  however  it may indicate the occurrence of a neoplasm 
Since the decline of tuberculosis in developed nations  lung cancer has become most feared among the people with a chronic cough 
The cough in lung cancer may develop de novo when there is no underlying chronic bronchitis and may be its only manifestation 
As chronic bronchitis and lung cancer are very uncommon among nonsmokers  a chronic persistent cough has a different significance in this population 
Airway hyperreactivity  the hallmark of bronchial asthma  is a rather common condition in which the cough may be the predominant or even the sole manifestation 
Patients with hyperreactive airways  without other manifestations of asthma  may have a chronic cough for as long as several years until the condition is suspected  accurately diagnosed  and properly treated 
Chronic postnasal drip  a frequent symptom of allergic or nonallergic rhinitis andor sinusitis  is implicated in many instances of a chronic cough 
A sensation of secretions dripping down into the throat and the feeling of a need to clear the throat are very suggestive of this disorder 
The chronic cough may be a manifestation of many other pathologic conditions involving the intra  and extrathoracic organs Table 
Left sided heart failure not only results in a cough with acute pulmonary edema but also may be a cause of a chronic nocturnal cough 
Recurrent aspiration is another condition in which the cough characteristically occurs in a supine position 
Foreign body aspiration should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of the chronic cough 
After the initial coughing or choking episode at the time of its aspiration  the cough may restart and continue long after the incident 
Other  less common intraluminal or compressing lesions of the tracheobronchial tree  chronic inflammatory or fibrosing lung diseases  and extrapulmonary lesions may have cough as their predominant symptom 
Tumors of the mediastinum  enlarged heart chambers  and pleural disease may manifest with cough 
A psychogenic or intentional cough for personal gain should be seriously considered only when other causes are properly excluded 
The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril  used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure  are being increasingly recognized as a cause of a dry  annoying  and often incessant cough  which disappears only after the discontinuation of these agents 
Characteristics of expectorated sputum often suggest the diagnosis of its cause 
Chronic expectoration of large amounts of purulent and foul smelling sputum is strongly suggestive of bronchiectasis 
Sudden production of such a sputum in a febrile patient indicates a lung abscess 
Rust colored purulent sputum in pneumococcal pneumonia  currant jelly and sticky sputum in klebsiella pneumonia  and blood tinged foamy sputum in pulmonary edema are other examples in which the diagnosis of the underlying disease is strongly suggested 
A cough with the expectoration of blood hemoptysis is discussed in Chapter
