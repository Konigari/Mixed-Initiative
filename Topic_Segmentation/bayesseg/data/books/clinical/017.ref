A bruit is an audible vascular sound associated with turbulent blood flow 
Although usually heard with the stethoscope  such sounds may occasionally also be palpated as a thrill 
In the head and neck  these auscultatory sounds may originate in the heart cardiac valvular murmurs radiating to the neck  the cervical arteries carotid artery bruits  the cervical veins cervical venous hum  or arteriovenous AV connections intracranial AV malformations 
These sounds may be normal  innocent findings i e   a venous hum in a child or may point to underlying pathology i e   a carotid artery bruit caused by atherosclerotic stenosis in an adult 
Head and neck bruits loom especially important today because physicians encounter arterial occlusive disease more frequently as a greater proportion of our population lives longer 
What are the clinical circumstances where head and neck auscultation is indicated 
Evaluation often begins with patient symptoms related to cardiovascular or neurologic disease 
This involves a through  directed physical examination following pertinent historical information 
Second  the necessity for head and neck auscultation may be part of repeated or sequential physical examinations directed by new data from subsequent history  physical examination  or laboratory information obtained later in the hospital course 
Finally  auscultation of head and neck vascular sounds may be part of a routine  complete comprehensive physical examination  especially in subsets of patients at risk for neurologic or cardiovascular disease 
Cranial and orbital bruits are vibrations resulting from turbulence in intracranial or extracranial vessels 
Although usually systolic in timing  these bruits may extend into diastole or even be continuous 
These sounds may originate within the cranium or be transmitted from arteries in the neck or  occasionally  from cardiac valvular lesions 
The orbits provide relative windows for transmission of intracranial sounds  with minimal bony dissipation 
Indication for cranial and orbital auscultation usually follows from historical physical examination or laboratory evidence of cranialcervical disorders such as seizures  headaches  stroke syndromes  intracranial mass lesions  or carotid bruits 
Neck auscultation is commonly indicated for initial evaluation of stenotic or embolic cerebrovascular symptoms  or as part of a comprehensive physical examination in asymptomatic patients at risk for atherosclerosis 
Cervical bruits and hums may arise from neck arteries or veins  and may be innocuous findings or indicate underlying pathology 
Bruits arising in the carotid arteries are produced by intrinsic stenosis or  occasionally  with vascular occlusion from extrinsic compression 
Depending on a variety of factors  these bruits may be systolic  primarily systolic with extension into diastole  or continuous 
The cervical venous hum is auscultated over the internal jugular veins in many normal children 
Commonly a continuous high pitched sound  it is occasionally more prominent in diastole 
It occurs more frequently on the right than on the left  and may be present bilaterally 
Supraclavicular bruits during systole are a frequent finding in normal children and in adults with subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis 
Supraclavicular auscultation is usually initiated to evaluate vertebral artery occlusive symptoms  arm claudication  or subclavian steal in the adult with atherosclerosis

By the management of pressure with a stethoscope over or near large veins  the venous murmur may often be raised  by a gradual swelling  into a more or less musical hum 
I propose to denominate this venous hum 
James Hope 
In physical evaluation of these sounds  an important aspect is their relationship to the cardiac cycle 
Equally important and useful is an appreciation of their dynamic qualitythat is  findings may change from time to time in the same patient depending on a variety of factors e g   activity  stress  fever 
From a physical diagnosis standpoint  this dynamic characteristic may be exploited by use of maneuvers designed to alter these vascular sounds in predictable ways 
Auscultation should take place in a quiet room with both patient and examiner relaxed and comfortable 
Although it is often stated that what one puts in the ears is of less importance than what lies between them  an efficient  well designed stethoscope is indispensable! 
Cranial bruits should be listened for over the skull and eyeballs  the latter location being the most favorable for fainter sounds 
The sitting patient is asked to close both eyes gently  and the examiner  facing the patient  places the stethoscope bell firmly over one closed eye 
The examiner's other hand thumb rests lightly on the contralateral carotid artery for timing purposes and for steadying the head and neck Figure 
The patient is then asked to open the other eye and look at a fixed object  as this helps eliminate eyelid tremor 
Finally  the patient is asked to hold his breath 
Orbital bruits may be faint and high pitched  and the examiner should concentrate especially on the systolic phase of the cardiovascular cycle 
After orbital examination  the patient's skull is auscultated with the bell over the mastoid  frontal  and parietal areas 
Auscultation is then carried out over the other eye and hemicranium in a similar manner  comparing symmetrical regions if indicated 
The examiner should allow the patient to resume respirations after each auscultation 
At the outset of cervical auscultation  the carotid arteries are lightly palpated individually and then simultaneously to acquire a feel for the examination to follow 
This palpation must be gentle so as to avoid inadvertent carotid sinus pressure and massage 
Then carotid artery auscultation is initiated with the patient either supine or sitting 
In the latter position  approaching the patient from behind allows optimal simultaneous carotid palpation and auscultation 
The patient's chin points straight ahead  and the stethoscope bell is applied to achieve a skin seal over the course of each carotid artery 
Simultaneous with auscultation  the examiner's free hand lightly rests on the contra lateral carotid artery for timing purposes 
Then the patient is asked to inspire deeply and hold the breath without Valsalva for  to  seconds 
Auscultation continues during and immediately after breath holding 
Holding the breath not only eliminates breath sounds that make hearing a bruit difficult but also accentuates an internal carotid bruit see Basic Science 
With the patient holding his breath  the examiner next compresses the contralateral common carotid artery slightly to determine whether this alters the length or intensity of a bruit 
Remember that transient focal cerebral ischemia has been reported from digital pressure on neck carotid arteries  so diagnostic carotid palpation is probably contraindicated in a patient with preexistent brain ischemia 
Finally  the examiner combines patient breath holding with simultaneous compression of both the ipsilateral superficial temporal and facial arteries Figure 
This last maneuver may be accomplished from behind or while facing the patient 
Several other vascular sounds may be auscultated in the cervical region and must be differentiated from carotid bruits 
In children  auscultation at the base of the neck just above the clavicle and lateral to the sternocleidomastoid muscle often reveals a venous hum 
The examiner faces the sitting patient and applies the bell lightly  while the patient holds the breath without bearing down 
If the examiner hears a venous hum  it can be intensified by asking the patient to inspire deeply 
It is obliterated by lightly compressing the jugular vein just cephalad to the point of auscultation Figure    or by having the patient recline or perform a Valsalva maneuver 
Differentiation of carotid bruits from transmitted cardiac murmurs sometimes poses a problem 
The examiner may slowly inch the stethoscope down the carotid  cardiac murmurs should increase in intensity as the stethoscope approaches the precordium 
Appropriate and consistent physical findings over the precordium should also clarify this issue 
Moreover  cardiac murmurs are only rarely transmitted over the eye  whereas carotid bruits are 
Arterial tortuosity and kinking  which may be palpated in the cervical region  can be a source of turbulence and bruits 
Also  compression syndromes  such as the cervical rib or scalenus anticus syndrome  may also be manifest by bruits in the neck 
The compression and resulting bruit may be increased by having the patient brace the shoulders back and inspire deeply while the examiner exerts mild downward traction on the homolateral arm Adson's maneuver 
The examiner may simultaneously palpate the radial pulse  which should diminish during this maneuver 
Supradavicular auscultation is performed while the patient sits looking forward  with the shoulders relaxed and hands resting on the lap 
The stethoscope bell is lightly applied in each supraclavicular fossa over the subclavian artery 
As usual  the examiner's free hand palpates the contralateral carotid pulse for timing purposes 
If a bruit is appreciated  firmly compress the patient's ipsilateral radial artery  noting the effect on the murmur 
Finally  with the patient supine  continue auscultation after he or she repeatedly squeezes a rubber ball or other pliable object for  to  seconds 
The patient is supine because such exercise may provoke syncope or arm pain while altering the observed bruit

Whatever constricts an orifice  whatever dilates a cavity  whatever establishes an orifice or cavity where none shall be  will disturb the even flow of blood and produce vibrations and a murmur 
Samuel Jones Gee 
Interpretation of vascular sounds in any anatomic location requires a basic understanding of vascular hemodynamics 
An arterial bruit usually implies stenosis at or proximal to the site of auscultation 
Very severe obstruction  however  may not manifest a bruit  conversely  bruits may be heard over unoccluded normal arteries in certain high flow circumstances 
Because a bruit may be auscultated directly over a stenosis  or distally in the direction of the blood jet producing the vibrations  it is important to trace proximally the audibility of an arterial sound to determine the exact anatomic site of the flow disturbance 
Intraarterial pressureflow relationships are approximated as follows 
In most regional vascular beds  the resistance of the main axial artery is quite low compared with peripheral arteriolar resistance 
Distal arteriolar tone  therefore  is the prime determinant of pressure and flow 
For example  during extremity exercise  arteriolar vasodilatation occurs  markedly lowering resistance and immediately increasing limb blood flow  while pressure remains relatively constant 
With prolonged exercise  extremity blood flow may increase  to  times over resting levels 
As arterial stenosis increases  however  resistance at the site of stenosis gradually assumes more importance 
When stenosis becomes very severe  exercise induced peripheral arteriolar vasodilatation cannot produce an increase in flow  and a pressure gradient then develops across the stenotic lesion 
Critical stenosis  which substantially changes pressure and flow across an occlusion  does not occur until the cross sectional area of an artery is reduced by more than 
This reduction in cross sectional area corresponds to a  reduction in lumen diameter 
Thereafter  the magnitude of the pressure gradient depends on the extent of the fixed lesion  if all other factors remain constant 
For any instantaneous stenotic flow 
As stenosis increases  therefore  potential energy pressure proximal to the stenosis changes to increasing kinetic energy velocity within the stenosis 
With increasing flow velocity  laminar flow through a stenosis eventually changes to turbulent flow  producing vibrations and a bruit 
Thus  velocity through the stenotic segment and the subsequent character of the bruit depend on the degree of stenosis and the resulting pressure gradient 
If only the degree of stenosis is considered  the auscultatory quality and timing of the resultant bruit follow directly 
A soft early systolic bruit is noted with a lumen diameter of 
As the obstruction increases to   the bruit becomes high pitched  more intense  and holosystolic 
At  to  diameter reduction  a pressure gradient may remain even during diastole  and the bruit is auscultated in both systole and early diastole 
Complete occlusion or even very severe stenosis may cause diminution and disappearance of a bruit when blood flow turbulence is not sufficient to cause audible vibrations 
Additional extrastenotic factors operating in most regional vascular beds alter flow and pressure and bruit characteristics for any fixed stenotic lesion 
These factors may be divided into four categories  inflow factors  side branch factors  collateral vessel development  and outflow factors Figure 
The presence or absence of these variables can affect bruit features and often can be altered for diagnostic purposes 
From a diagnostic viewpoint  maneuvers accentuating or localizing bruits are helpful during physical examination 
Awareness of all factors influencing pressure and flow across a stenosis thus allows estimation of degree andor location of that stenosis 
Inflow factors mimicking high grade stenosis in a given arterial segment include high cardiac output states 
High output conditions may produce bruits even in normal non stenotic arteries 
In the second category side branch factors  compression of arterial side branches should augment a bruit in the main artery and diminish a side branch bruit  whereas augmentation of flow through a side branch would have the opposite effect 
This concept is especially applicable for evaluation of carotid artery bruits 
The extent of collateral circulation around a critical stenosis influences the characteristics of a bruit 
With internal carotid artery stenosis  for example  collateral formation is usually limited  and the character and timing of a bruit correlate rather closely with the degree of stenosis 
In contrast  in the lower extremity  extensive collateral circulation may develop around a stenosis  thus altering the gradient across that stenosis and obscuring the degree of narrowing 
Outflow factors are often important in vascular auscultation 
Arteriolar vasodilatation caused by regional exercise is valuable for accentuating bruits in the extremities 
These principles apply directly to auscultation of cranial  cervical  and supraclavicular vessels 
The aortic arch arteries are a common site of atherosclerotic lesions   of which arise at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries 
Detection of internal carotid lesions is obviously important  but  of carotid bruits originate in the external carotid arteries  representing little risk of subsequent stroke 
Side branch factors can be dynamically altered during cervical auscultation to accentuate andor localize a carotid bruit 
After carotid auscultation at rest  the examiner compresses the superficial temporal and facial arteries arising from the ipsilateral external carotid artery Figure 
An internal carotid bruit may become louder and longer  whereas an external carotid bruit generally becomes noticeably shorter and softer with compression 
Internal carotid outflow factors may be altered during cervical auscultation 
Carbon dioxide is a powerful vasodilator of normal cerebral vessels 
Holding the breath raises arterial carbon dioxide tension  causing active dilatation of cerebral arterioles and augmenting blood flow through intracerebral arterioles 
Breath holding ordinarily causes a  increase in internal carotid bruit intensity  whereas a decrease occurs in external carotid murmurs 
Internal carotid outflow also increases with careful compression of the contralateral common carotid artery during auscultation 
This compression decreases flow through the circle of Willis  with intensification and prolongation of an internal carotid bruit  and diminution of an external carotid murmur see Table 
for summary 
Artenovenous fistulas and malformations shunt large volumes of blood at rapid flow from high pressure arteries into low pressure veins  producing a continuous murmur with systolic accentuation 
The turbulence of the venous hum  heard over the internal jugular veins  is caused by the combined effects of gravity on blood flow and partial compression of the internal jugular vein by the transverse process of the atlas 
This hum occurs more frequently on the right side  partly because the right internal jugular and innominate veins provide short  straight access to the superior vena cava  thus increasing flow velocity in the right jugular venous return 
A Valsalva maneuver  manual compression of the internal jugular vein  and the recumbent position all decrease venous flow and obliterate this sound 
In contrast  conditions such as upright posture  rapid atrial filling diastole  and inspiration all increase jugular venous flow and accentuate a venous hum 
In supraclavicular auscultation  arm exercise has been utilized to increase bruits caused by stenosis in a subclavian artery 
Local exercise of an extremity supplied by a stenotic artery should increase peripheral outflow  producing greater stenotic turbulence and augmenting a bruit 
In contrast  ipsilateral radial artery compression  which decreases subclavian outflow  should shorten or obliterate a subclavian murmur

The trained ear is probably still the best instrument for recognition of most murmurs 
Abe Ravin 
After a vascular sound is auscultated in the head  neck  or supraclavicular fossa  the examiner must determine the significance of the sound 
Is it nonorganic innocent  pointing to no regional anatomic disease 
Or is it organic pathologic  indicating localized vascular obstruction and need for further evaluation? 
Cranial and orbital bruits Table 
are usually normal  innocent findings in younger persons  occurring in  to  of normal infants and children under  years of age 
In adults  nonorganic orbital bruits may be noted in patients with high cardiac output states  or those with decreased blood viscosity  as with severe anemia 
Often systolic in timing and auscultated over both orbits  these bruits are especially frequent in patients with several simultaneous reasons for increased vascular flow  such as anemia and high fever 
If the above conditions are excluded  cranial orbital bruits in the adult are usually organic pathologic and indicate an underlying abnormality 
Arteriovenous fistulas  arteriovenous malformations  and intracranial hemangiomas are associated with a prominent bruit in  to  of cases Table 
Often these are continuous bruits and are appreciated best over the orbits  where osseous dissipation of vibrations is minimized 
Atherosclerosis of the arteries in the neck may rarely produce an orbital bruit 
With tight internal carotid stenosis  either extracranially or intracranially at the carotid siphon  a bruit may radiate cephalad and be auscultated over the ipsilateral orbit 
With total unilateral carotid occlusion  there may be no bruit over the affected carotid and increased flow through the unoccluded carotid  which can cause a soft bruit over the contralateral eyeball Table 
Other intracranial pathology affecting vascular structures may produce soft systolic orbital bruits Tables 
and 
Positive ausculatory findings should suggest these diagnoses only if the entire clinical picture is supportive 
As suggested previously  nonorganic innocent vascular sounds are common in the cervical region and obviously must be differentiated from organic pathologic bruits 
Children and adults with high cardiac output often have innocent cervical bruits related to high carotid flow 
The venous hum  common in normal children  is less frequent in adults except in high cardiac output states 
If especially loud in young persons  the hum may radiate to the first and second intercostal spaces and be misdiagnosed as a patent ductus arteriosus if heard on the left 
As mentioned previously  valvular cardiac murmurs often radiate to the neck 
The murmurs of aortic stenosis  and of mitral regurgitation caused by prolapse or by ruptured chordae tendineae  may radiate to the neck and must be distinguished from carotid artery pathology 
Cervical arterial tortuosity and compression syndromes are usually of no pathologic consequence 
All the above ausculatory entities can be differentiated from carotid bruits by clinical techniques discussed previously 
Another cause of neck bruits unrelated to carotid pathology is the cervical bruit of thyrotoxicosis see Chapter 
In this condition  blood flow through the enlarged thryoid gland increases five  to tenfold  producing a systolic bruit directly over the thyrotoxic goiter 
One must distinguish this bruit from a venous hum or an innocent high flow carotid bruit  findings also present in severe thyrotoxicosis 
If the above nonorganic conditions are eliminated  a cervical bruit should raise the question of carotid artery stenosis with its associated risk of ischemic stroke 
Eight million adults in this country have carotid bruits  one third of whom have experienced focal ischemic symptoms 
The Joint Study of Extracranial Arterial Occlusion estimates that  of patients with ischemic stroke syndromes have at least one obstructive lesion at a surgically accessible site 
The usual cause of cervical artery obstruction is atherosclerosis 
The exact role of vascular surgery in patients with truly asymptomatic bruits  and in those who have bruits with transient ischemic symptoms or bruits with previous cerebral infarction  continues to be debated vigorously 
Nevertheless  diagnosis begins in the office or at the bedside 
Even a silent neck may harbor advanced atherosclerotic disease because bruits are not present over total carotid occlusion  or when residual lumen diameter is less than  mm 
But otherwise  cervical auscultation for carotid associated symptoms of central nervous system disease can localize and grade a stenotic lesion producing transient ischemic attacks TIAs 
With increasing occlusion  an internal carotid bruit becomes higher pitched  more intense  and longer in duration  even extending into diastole with very tight stenosis 
Moreover  dynamic maneuvers may accentuate a bruit caused by a plaque narrowing the artery only minimally  but still producing TIAs by microembolization 
Or  if a carotid bruit can be localized to the external carotid artery   no further evaluation is usually required  however  an asymptomatic internal carotid bruit should at least be followed closely 
Even a truly asymptomatic carotid bruit may warn of future morbidity from atherosclerotic disease in other parts of the body because evidence of atherosclerotic disease in one region often indicates significant lesions in other vascular areas 
A vascular history suggesting stenotic or embolic central nervous system CNS symptoms obviously dictates detailed neck examination  but thorough cervical auscultation is not limited to analysis of symptoms 
Disclosure of arterial bruits is beneficial in the screening and preoperative evaluation of patient groups at high risk for atherosclerotic disease 
Such groups include older persons and those with coronary artery disease  hypertension  diabetes mellitus  lipid disorders  or a history of cigarette smoking 
As noted  cervical examination is also part of the follow up of previously recognized bruits  both before and after surgical correction 
Neck auscultation sometimes yields confusing or anomalous results 
Findings must be verified with noninvasive or invasive imaging before surgical treatment can be considered and undertaken 
Appropriate care usually involves close consultation between the primary care provider and a neurologist  with a vascular surgeon consulted later if surgery is warranted 
Pertinent initial physical examination allows more discriminate use of subsequent invasive or expensive diagnostic modalities and referrals 
Innocent supraclavicular systolic bruits are often heard in normal children or adolescents 
These are usually abrupt systolic sounds of brief duration that probably originate within major brachiocephalic arteries near their aortic origins 
Such bruits may be surprisingly loud  and radiate widely 
These innocent murmurs tend to decrease or vanish when the shoulders are hyperextended 
In contrast  supraclavicular murmurs in older persons may indicate significant vertebral or subclavian artery stenosis 
If anamnesis and dynamic physical examination indicate symptomatic high grade stenosis  subsequent evaluation may be indicated
