Introduction

   This archive contains an annotation of the structure of 25 meetings
   taken from the ICSI Meeting corpus.

Corpus Description

   Each meeting transcription was segmented by at least three labelers.
   From their annotation, we built a reference segmentation (the procedure
   is described in the next section). It consists of the following files:

       3 "even deeper understanding" meetings meetings:
       Bed003.ref  Bed004.ref  Bed011.ref

       19 "meeting recorder" meetings:
       Bmr001.ref  Bmr002.ref  Bmr005.ref  Bmr007.ref  Bmr008.ref  
       Bmr009.ref  Bmr010.ref  Bmr011.ref  Bmr012.ref  Bmr013.ref  
       Bmr014.ref  Bmr018.ref  Bmr021.ref  Bmr022.ref  Bmr024.ref  
       Bmr025.ref  Bmr026.ref  Bmr027.ref  Bmr029.ref

       3 "robustness" meetings:
       Bro004.ref  Bro007.ref  Bro015.ref

   In these files, each line corresponds to a segment, characterized by a 
   start time and, optionally, by a tag representing special segments.
   The optional tag is one of the following:

   - cut    : pre-meeting discussion; this speech that isn't really part of
              the meeting and is identified as such.
   - agenda : agenda of the meeting.
   - digits

   There is no gap between segments, so the end time of a segment is
   determined by the start time of the following one (for the last 
   segment, by the end time of the meeting).

Reference Segmentation

   We had to be careful in order to determine a reference segmentation based
   on the segmentation of 3+ labelers. The main issue is that annotators
   rarely mark boundaries at the exact same position (assigning a specific 
	time to a topic shift is generally quite subjective). Our idea was the
   following: two boundaries found by two different annotators are considered
   equivalent if they are separated by no more than 20 seconds. This
	defines sets of equivalent boundaries (no speaker can contribute more than 
	one boundary per set), and for each set, labelers had to determine if there 
	is majority opinion (i.e. the number of boundaries in a set is more than 
	half the number of speakers). If there is a majority, we add the median in 
	the set to the reference segmentation. We had two labeleres to take a 
	decision in difficult cases (e.g. when there are several boundaries in a 
	span longer than 20 seconds.)
