Muscle cramp denotes an episodic  involuntary  painful contraction of a muscle 
Muscle spasm is a more encompassing term referring to any involuntary muscle contraction 
==========
Muscle cramps are ubiquitous yet tend to be little more than a benign nuisance to the sufferer 
On occasion  though  the physician encounters either patients who complain of cramps or might want to inquire as to their presence while evaluating a related symptom 
There is nothing unique in taking a history of cramps  the aims being both to characterize the complaint fully and to extract clues that might reveal its cause 
This can be accomplished by having the patient describe the symptom  then asking directed questions as necessary to elaborate information as to the quality  location  duration  precipitating and relieving maneuvers  course of the symptom  and associated features 
Many patients who complain of cramps actually have some other related phenomenon 
What characteristics  then  can be helpful in making the correct diagnosis? 
  Quality 
It is useful to find out about onset abrupt or slow?  sensation painful 
stiff?  and appearance if an abnormal posture is described  have the patient demonstrate it 
With true cramps  the onset is sudden  the muscle feels taut and painful  and usually it is visibly and palpably knotted although this may not be readily apparent if only part of the muscle is involved 
 Location 
Determine if muscles are involved singly or in groups  if certain muscles are consistently involved  and if the cramps remain limited or spread 
While ordinary cramps often affect the leg especially calf muscles  other locations may point to a specific syndrome such as carpopedal spasms in tetany or unilateral facial involvement in hemifacial spasms 
 Duration 
Ordinary cramps last from seconds to several minutes if severe 
Fleeting twitches or prolonged contractions suggest another type of disorder 
 Precipitating or relieving maneuvers 
Attempt to uncover any relation to exercise  specifically  find out not only if occurrence is at rest or during or after exercise but also the duration and intensity of exercise that may initiate cramps 
Moreover  clarify if the cramps appear only sporadically or can be predictably expected at a certain level of exertion 
One may also want to ask about other potential triggers such as movement  sensory or emotional stimuli  hyperventilation  cold  or fasting 
Assess if anything alleviates the cramps 
 Course of symptoms 
A relatively recent onset suggests the possibility of an acquired intercurrent illness  whereas affliction since youth may point to an inherited disorder 
It is important to recognize several entities that may be confused with cramps 
With disorders of muscle relaxation  as in myotonia and hypothyroidism  the patient may perceive an uncomfortable but painless muscle tightness or stiffness  often made worse in the cold 
One can get a clue to myotonia if the patient admits to difficulty releasing a grip be it a handshake  doorknob  or cooking pan that improves with repeated contractions 
Other rare ailments can produce a sensation of stiffness via various mechanisms see Table 
Focal dystonias share certain similarities and may easily be mistaken for cramps 
Dystonia refers to a movement disorder manifest by the assumption of involuntary abnormal postures 
Patients may relate spasmodic  even painful  bending or twisting movements of an extremity  neck  face or trunk that remain in a persistent attitude e g   overextendedoverflexed posture of hand  inversion of foot  pulling of the head to one side 
Sometimes the spasms occur in relation to and interfere with a specific skilled motor act  as in so called writer's cramp 
The slower onset  inappropriate contraction of many opposing muscles  and unusual postures evoked help to distinguish dystonia 
Far and away a more common patient complaint is that of a crampy feeling  by which is meant an aching discomfort in the muscles without any visible or palpable hardening 
These myalgias are common in childhood 
They can also be seen in a variety of neuromuscular and systemic illnesses  as well as in the context of generalized pervasive fatigue without objective muscle weakness in depressed patients 
It should be emphasized  though  that the above conditions  along with other abnormal muscle contractions  may occur in conjunction with actual muscle cramps 
Patients as historians can be lumpers or splittersthey may complain of cramps as one of many symptoms  or include a number of different phenomena under the rubric of cramps 
Once one has fully characterized the symptoms  the next step is to probe for associated features that may disclose an etiology 
Appropriate queries might include  Is there any weakness  numbness  or paresthesias present that may indicate an underlying neuromuscular disorder 
Has muscle twitching been noted 
Fasciculations spontaneous visible muscle twitches due to contraction of a motor unit can be seen in several neuropathic disorders associated with cramping 
They can also appear as a benign condition with muscle cramps  particularly in people with large muscles 
Do bouts of myoglobinuria occur 
This sign  reflecting muscle fiber breakdown  can be ascertained by asking if the urine ever becomes cola colored 
Be carefulpatients frequently say their urine becomes dark concentrated but rarely admit that it actually turns brownish 
Are there any concurrent illnesses or medications 
Spontaneous muscle cramps are associated with a number of conditions and medications see Table 
Is there a family history of cramps?

Normal voluntary motor activity depends on the functional integrity of not only the motor unit comprising a lower motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates but also the descending and spinal excitatory and inhibitory circuits that influence it 
Cramps may result from malfunction at various points in the pathway 
Muscle fibers contract in response to impulses generated by the lower motor neurons 
With the arrival of these impulses  or action potentials AP  at the presynaptic nerve terminals  the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released 
If there are sufficient amounts of acetylcholine to activate the postsynaptic receptors  a muscle AP is produced 
This AP is then transmitted to the interior of the muscle fiber where it liberates calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum a system of tubules that surround the contractile filaments  actin and myosin 
The calcium binds to a regulatory protein  permitting the chemical interaction of actin and myosin  which results in muscle shortening 
The energy for contraction is supplied by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ATP 
Muscle relaxation depends on active reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
This reuptake  too  is an energy dependent process requiring ATP 
Thus  if ATP is lacking  the muscle remains shortened even in the absence of continued action potentials 
This is known as contracture 
If  alternatively  reuptake occurs but a second AP arrives before the muscle has relaxed  the contraction will be continued 
At motor neuron firing frequencies of  to  Hz  the twitches fuse into a sustained contraction 
The activity of the motor neuron is modulated by spinal interneurons  which can  via presynaptic or postsynaptic inhibition  decrease motor neuron excitability 
The energy for muscle contraction can be produced by either carbohydrate or fatty acid metabolism 
Oversimply put  resting muscle predominantly utilizes lipid 
During intense anaerobic exercise  additional ATP is generated through glycogen breakdown 
With more prolonged mild to moderate activity  however  fatty acids again provide the principal fuel 
From this scheme  one could postulate a number of mechanisms for muscle cramps 
There may be impairment of normal descending or spinal inhibitory pathways with subsequent motor neuron overactivity 
Or there could be hyperirritability of motor nerves anywhere from the cell body to the terminal muscular branches 
At the level of the muscle fiber  a deficiency of ATP might prevent calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum  leaving the fiber in a shortened state 
Indeed  examples of every mechanism are thought to exist and are described in the next section

As mentioned previously  cramps can be due to a variety of causes 
Some cramps remain benign and mysterious  others are of a more definite nature and respond to specific therapy 
Ordinary muscle cramps are characterized by a painfully hard  palpable contraction of explosive onset  at times preceded or followed by brief twitches  which usually involves one muscle at a time 
They may be precipitated by volitional movement of trivial extent or more forceful contraction in a muscle already shortened as may occur during or after exercise 
The cramps can be terminated by passive stretching of the muscle or activation of its antagonist 
In severe cramps  the muscle may remain sore and tender for days 
While leg cramps are fairly common in the elderly  and hardly unusual in otherwise healthy  athletic individuals  they appear more frequently in certain clinical settings see Table 
The mechanism of such a relatively familiar malady has remained obscure  although a popular theory suggests that the intramuscular nerve branches are for some reason rendered hyperexcitable 
Clinically similar but on a different pathophysiologic basis are the cramps  or more correctly  contractures of muscle associated with various metabolic myopathies 
In several inherited disorders of glycogen metabolism  such as myophosphorylase McArdle's or phosphofructokinase Tauri's deficiency  patients classically experience myalgias and painful  hard muscle cramps only during vigorous exercise 
Occasionally  an episode of cramps will be followed by myoglobinuria  which  if excessive  could induce acute renal insufficiency 
Conversely  patients deficient in carnitine palmityl transferase  an enzyme critical for fatty acid oxidation  get cramps only during prolonged exercise  especially if in the fasted state  on a low carbohydrate diet  or in cold weather 
The proposed physiologic thread that ties these conditions together is acute depletion of ATP during exercise  disrupting calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and preventing muscle relaxation 
Tetany is a cramplike syndrome consisting of painless spasms  most notable for their carpopedal distribution but potentially involving other muscles 
The hand typically assumes a posture of tonic adduction of thumb and fingers  flexion of metacarpophalangeal joints  with extension of interphalangeal joints 
The toe becomes plantar flexed and the ankle inverted 
The spasms  commonly precipitated by hyperventilation  are preceded by tingling paresthesias of the mouth  fingers  and toes  a discriminative feature from dystonia 
Tetany is seen in states that cause alkalosis or reduction in ionized calcium and magnesium  which appear to render the peripheral nerves hyperirritable 
A more focal disorder of peripheral nerve function is hemifacial spasm 
Here  potentially any facial movement e g   blinking may provoke either fine twitching or prolonged gross spasms of facial muscles 
It is believed that most cases are attributable to compression of the facial nerve in the posterior fossa 
Tetanus  in contrast  is due to the suppression of spinal inhibitory neurons by an exotoxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani 
Clinically  involuntary spasms triggered by movement  sensory or emotional stimuli are superimposed on a state of virtually continuous stiffness 
The symptoms may begin in the vicinity of a wound and remain localized or  more often  become generalized 
Even in the localized form  one may note mild trismus due to the susceptibility of the masseter innervation 
Persistent muscular rigidity and painful cramps can also occur with strychnine poisoning  black widow spider bites  and the rare stiff man syndrome 
Patients with prominent spasticity due to spinal cord lesions frequently complain of stiffness  muscle cramps  and spasms 
Presumably  damage to the descending motor pathways disrupts the normal suprasegmental inhibitory influences on the spinal motor neurons  allowing afferent sensory impulses to evoke unbridled reflex activity 
As a result  flexor spasms of the thigh  knee  and foot can be set off by cutaneous or visceral e g   distended bladder stimuli 
Being reflexogenic in nature  they are at times accompanied by such autonomic responses as sweating  piloerection  or incontinence 
Other involuntary muscle hyperactivity states  including several rare familial syndromes  have been described and are reviewed elsewhere Layzer      Sumi et al
