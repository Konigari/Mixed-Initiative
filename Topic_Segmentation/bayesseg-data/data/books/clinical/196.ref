Chloride is an inorganic anionic halogen with an atomic weight of 
It is distributed exclusively within the extracellular fluid compartment ECF  which comprises the bloodplasma or serum compartment and the interstitial fluid compartment 
Chloride is the major anion associated with sodium in the ECF see Figure 
Normal serum chloride concentrations range from  to  mEqL 
==========
Several techniques for the determination of chloride are available including  the autoanalyzer a colorimetric techniqueSMA and ACA methods   a coulometric method   a mercurimetric method  and  chloride specific ion electrodes 
In the autoanalyzer method  chloride ions displace thiocyanate from mercuric thiocyanate 
The free thiocyanate reacts with ferric ions to form a colored complex  ferric thiocyanate  which is measured photometrically 
This technique is not specific for the chloride anion 
Other halogens  including bromide and sulfhydryl ions  react with mercuric thiocyanate 
Bromide has a greater affinity for the mercuric ion than chloride  so equimolar quantities of bromide yield more FeSCN than equimolar quantities of chloride 
Therefore a small amount of bromide will result in a reaction that will be read as a marked elevation in the serum chloride determination 
The Cotlove coulometric chloride titrator is another technique that measures the total chloride concentration 
With this method  the passage of a constant direct current between silver electrodes produces silver ions 
The free silver ions react with the chloride forming silver chloride 
After all the chloride combines with Ag+  free silver ions accumulate  causing an increase in current across the electrodes and indicating the end point to the reaction 
Although various halogens have differing affinities for Ag+  this method is insensitive to these differences  so  mEq of any halogen will result in the reaction being read as a  mEq rise in the serum chloride concentration 
When the serum chloride determination by the autoanalyzer is out of proportion to the determination by the chloride titrator technique  the presence of bromide is highly probable  and a serum bromide analysis should be performed 
In the mercurimetric method  chloride is titrated with a standard solution of mercuric ions and forms the soluble complex HgCl 
The end point for the reaction is detected colorimetrically when excess Hg++ combines with an indicator dye  diphenylcarbazone  to form a blue color 
Bromide will cause the same elevation of serum chloride as that which occurs during the coulometric titrator technique 
Chloride specific electrodes are solid state electrodes composed of membranes of AgCl 
These electrodes can measure chloride potentiometrically in serum and in small quantities of sweat 
Specific ion electrodes are presumably not susceptible to bromide or other halogen interference 
==========
The kidneys are responsible for the maintenance of total body chloride balance 
They maintain homeostasis because each kidney is composed of  million functional units  nephrons 
Part or all of the chloride filtered by the initial portion of each nephron  the glomerulus  will be reabsorbed as a result of both active and passive transport processes along the tubules comprising each nephron 
The ability of the nephrons to reabsorb chloride maintains the serum and ECF chloride concentration within a narrow range Figure 
The majority of the filtered chloride is reabsorbed with sodium during transport through the first portion of the tubule  the proximal tubule 
The reabsorption of chloride in this segment occurs in two phases 
In the initial portion of the proximal tubule  sodium entry into the cell is linked to active co transport of organic solutes Na glucose  Na amino acids  Na phosphate  and Na organic anions and to active secretion of H+ from the tubule cells and thus the reabsorption of HCO 
Both of these active processes raise the intraluminal chloride concentration thus producing  in the later segments of the proximal tubule  the passive movement of chloride along a favorable concentration and electrochemical gradient see Figure 
In the straight portion of the proximal tubule  the pars recta  chloride reabsorption continues as a result of passive diffusion down a favorable electrochemical gradient 
The descending limb of the loop of Henle  the next portion of the nephron  is relatively impermeable to NaCl  and no Na or Cl transport occurs 
In the next segment  the thick ascending limb loop of Henle  chloride is actively transported by a specific carrier mediated process and Na+ or K+ follows passively to maintain electroneutrality 
The most recent data suggest a model in which two Cl ions are transported for each Na+ and K+ 
Evidence also suggests that chloride transport is further increased in this segment through the generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate by antidiuretic hormone 
In the distal convoluted tubule  as in the proximal tubule  chloride transport may be passive or active 
It has been postulated  but not proven  that chloride transport is coupled to energy provided by the passive influx of sodium into the cell 
Other data suggest that the measured trans epithelial potential difference is sufficiently negative to explain chloride movement down a favorable electrochemical gradient 
The last segment of the nephron  the collecting duct  is composed of three segments  the cortical collecting tubule  the medullary collecting tubule  and the papillary collecting tubule 
Chloride transport occurs as a result of both active and passive processes in the cortical collecting duct  but by only active transport processes in the papillary collecting duct 
No data are currently available for the medullary collecting duct 
In summary  both active and passive transport processes are important in the reabsorption of chloride by the nephrons of the kidney 
The proximal tubule appears responsible for reabsorbing the majority of the filtered chloride  and the ascending loop of Henle reabsorbs another significant amount 
The distal tubule and collecting duct  although reabsorbing a smaller quantity of chloride  may also play an important role in this balance 
The quantity of chloride excreted into the urine i e   not reabsorbed by the tubules of the nephron is not constant  but varies from day to day depending on whether the kidneys are trying to conserve or eliminate chloride 
This ability of the kidneys to vary daily chloride excretion keeps total body chloride values relatively constant and maintains serum chloride concentrations within a narrow range despite marked daily variations in chloride intake 
The presence of specific clinical disorders can affect the ability of the kidneys to maintain chloride balance 
The result is hyperchloremia elevated serum chloride concentrations or hypochloremia reduced serum chloride concentrations 
==========
The serum chloride value  like the serum sodium value  is a concentration measurement e g   the amount of chlorideliter of plasma water 
Therefore  the serum chloride concentration can be elevated above the normal rangehyperchloremiaeither by the addition of excess chloride to the ECF compartment or by the loss of water from this compartment  and vice versa 
The serum chloride concentration can be reduced below the normal rangehypochloremiaby the loss of chloride from the ECF or the addition of water to this compartment 
This means that one cannot evaluate total body chloride stores from the serum chloride concentration 
Clinical parameters must be used in conjunction with serum chloride values to assess the significance of hypochloremia or hyperchloremia 
Total body chloride depletion can result from both extrarenal and renal causes see Table 
Extrarenal causes include inadequate sodium chloride intake  losses of certain gastrointestinal fluids e g   vomiting and nasogastric suction associated with loss of HCl  or diarrhea as a result of abnormalities in small bowel transport  and loss of fluids through the skin occurring as a result of trauma e g   burns 
Severe vomiting may lead to the most disproportionate loss of chloride compared to sodium since gastric chloride content is greater than  mEqL and gastric sodium content is relatively low  to  mEqL 
In individuals with protracted vomiting or nasogastric suction  the serum sodium concentration may be only mildly depressed  mEqL  whereas the serum chloride concentration is usually markedly lowered  to  mEqL 
The most reduced levels of serum chloride range  to  mEqL are associated with pernicious forms of vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction  protracted vomiting in alcoholics  or self induced vomiting 
Individuals with hypochloremia secondary to total body chloride depletion will have physical findings that indicate ECF volume contraction e g   hypotension  tachycardia  and orthostatic changes in blood pressure 
Further support of total body chloride and sodium depletion is the finding of low concentrations of sodium and chloride in the urine 
Renal causes of chloride and sodium losses include diuretic abuse  particularly loop diuretics  osmotic diuresis e g   mannitol  diabetic ketoacidosis  or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma  renal diseases associated with a salt losing nephropathy including interstitial nephritis  chronic renal failure  postobstructive diuresis  and conditions associated with adrenal insufficiency e g 
lack of endogeneous or exogeneous glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids 
The physical findings in individuals with hypochloremia as a result of renal losses of sodium and chloride will be similar to individuals with extrarenal chloride losses 
In these individuals  however  the concentration of chloride and sodium in the urine will be elevated  indicating renal losses of chloride and sodium despite evidence of ECF volume contraction 
Another finding often associated with total chloride depletion is metabolic alkalosis blood pH greater than 
The reabsorption of sodium bicarbonate NaHCO in the proximal and distal tubule is augmented because total body chloride depletion results in both ECF volume contraction which stimulates HCO reabsorption and decreased quantities of filtered chloride available to the tubules for reabsorption with sodium 
The virtual absence of chloride in the urine in the presence of a metabolic alkalosis is a strong indication that total body chloride depletion is present 
Augmented reabsorption of NaHCO will persist until adequate quantities of chloride are administered andor the volume of the ECF compartment is normalized 
Metabolic alkalosis also increases potassium excretion by the kidneys which can lead to hypokalemia 
A number of chloride containing solutions can be used to correct total body chloride depletion including isotonic sodium chloride normal saline  physiologic saline for replacement of just sodium and chloride  potassium chloride for replacement of potassium and chloride  and lysine monochloride  arginine monochloride  ammonium chloride  or HCl when acid replacement is necessary in conditions associated with chloride depletion and severe metabolic alkalosis 
Clinical conditions associated with excess water retention can cause a dilutional hyponatremia with a proportionate decrease in the chloride concentration see Table 
This form of hypochloremia does not reflect total body chloride or sodium depletion  and  in fact  many of the conditions associated with dilutional hypochloremia have a normal or increased total body content of chloride and sodium 
Individuals with dilutional hypochloremia generally have a normal or elevated blood pressure and evidence of ECF volume expansion 
The sodium and chloride urine concentrations are variable depending on the underlying medical condition 
Specific acid base abnormalities may also be associated with hypochloremia 
Conditions associated with a respiratory acidosis e g   retention of CO as with chronic obstructive lung disease cause the proximal tubule to increase its secretion of hydrogen ion 
This results in sodium being retained prefentially as sodium bicarbonate and not sodium chloride 
Although this is a compensatory mechanism to help ameliorate the acidemia  the end result is increased concentrations of serum bicarbonate greater than  mEqL and decreased serum chloride concentrations 
Conditions causing dilutional hyponatremia and hypochloremia do not require chloride containing fluids  since they do not have total body chloride depletion 
However  respiratory acidosis associated with hypochloremia may need chloride containing fluids if a metabolic alkalosis andor hypokalemia is also present 
Hyperchloremia is also associated with a variety of clinical conditions see Table 
Conditions causing an elevation of the serum chloride concentration and a concomitant elevation of the serum sodium concentration result primarily from disorders associated with loss of electrolyte free fluids pure water loss  hypotonic fluids water deficit in excess of sodium and chloride deficits  or administration of NaCl containing fluids 
Loss of electrolyte free fluids occurs in conditions with increased insensible losses as a result of increased sweating e g   fever  hypermetabolic states thyrotoxicosis  increased ambient room temperature and inadequate water replacement as a result of loss of thirst perception as seen in the elderly  in ill infants  and in individuals with altered mental status stroke patients  postanesthesia  and narcotic medications 
This results in hypotonic dehydration e g   loss of TBW and contraction of the ICF and ECF compartments and an elevation in both the serum sodium and chloride concentrationhypernatremia and hyperchloremia 
Loss of electrolyte free fluids also occurs in clinical conditions associated with central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
Both conditions are associated with an inability to concentrate the urine and large volumes of dilute urine urine osmolality less than plasma osmolality 
However  hypernatremia and hyperchloremia will not develop in association with either of these latter abnormalities as long as individuals drink adequate amounts of fluid or are given adequate quantities of electrolyte free intravenous fluids to replace the daily urine losses 
Loss of hypotonic fluids occurs with certain types of diarrhea states and burns  in conditions associated with an osmotic diuresis e g   diabetic glycosuria  mannitol  glycerol  diuretics  following a postobstructive diuresis  and in association with some intrinsic renal diseases 
Since more water is lost relative to sodium  the serum sodium chloride concentration rises 
But since some sodium and chloride are excreted into the urine  the serum sodium and chloride concentrations will not be as elevated as that occurring in conditions associated with loss of electrolyte free fluids 
Administration of NaCl containing fluids can also result in hypernatremia and hyperchloremia if excessive quantities of hypertonic solutions of sodium chloride  or  are given iatrogenically in place of  DW or inadvertently administered during instillation in utero for a second semester abortion 
It can also be found in association with saltwater drowning 
Administration of hypertonic tube feedings without the concurrent administration of adequate quantities of free water to dilute the feedings to isotonicity can also cause hypernatremia and hyperchloremia 
Individuals with hyperchloremia secondary to electrolyte free fluid losses will have physical findings of dehydration  dry mucous membranes  coated tongue  and no axillary sweat 
Urine chloride and sodium concentrations may or may not be helpful 
However  the finding of a dilute urine Uosm less than  mOsm with low chloride and sodium concentrations in the presence of hyperchloremia and hypernatremia most likely confirms the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus 
With the loss of hypotonic fluids  individuals will have findings of both dehydration a result of electrolyte free fluid losses and sodium depletion 
As a consequence of the latter  such individuals will have evidence of ECF contraction hypotension  tachycardia  orthostatic hypotension in addition 
In contrast  individuals with hyperchloremia secondary to administration of NaCl containing solutions will have physical findings indicative of an expanded ECF volume  hypertension  edema  congestive heart failure  and pulmonary edema 
Elevated levels of serum chloride without increased levels of serum sodium occur as a result of clinical conditions that predispose to a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis 
Individuals with this acid base disturbance have a serum chloride concentration above  mEqL and a low bicarbonate concentration in association with an acidemic blood pH pH lower than 
Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can occur when the kidney tubules either proximal or distal do not reabsorb adequate quantities of the bicarbonate filtered by the glomerulus 
Disorders causing intrinsic damage to the tubules e g   interstitial nephritis  drugs that block bicarbonate reabsorption e g   carbonic anhydrase inhibitorsacetazolamide  and topically applied sulfur drugs and their metabolites used as a topical antibiotic in burn patients result in the condition called renal tubular acidosis RTA 
A diagnosis of RTA can frequently be made if one finds a blood pH that is acidemic in association with a nonacidic urine a urine pH above 
Other causes of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis include conditions associated with severe diarrhea having losses of bicarbonate equivalents e g   lactate and acetate  ureteral diversion procedures  which often have hyperreabsorption of chloride by the interposed bowel segment  and ingestion of acidic chloride containing salts NHCl  arginine chloride  and lysine chloride  or acidic salts of amino acids found in some hyperalimentation solutions 
Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can also be seen in the early stages of chronic renal failure  especially secondary to conditions resulting from interstitial renal damage  in the recovery phase of diabetic ketoacidosis loss of ketone bodies in the urine prevents them from being converted to bicarbonate in the liver and results in bicarbonate deficits  and in primary hyperparathyroidism which is associated with renal bicarbonate losses 
In addition  respiratory alkalosis  a condition seen in individuals with hyperventilation e g   sepsis  pregnancy  pulmonary infections  anxiety is associated with an elevated serum chloride concentration and a low bicarbonate concentration 
An arterial blood pH will help distinguish between hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis 
Hyperchloremia is also seen with bromide intoxication because bromide is measured as a chloride equivalent by certain chloride measurement techniques 
This results in the finding of an anion gap as measured by the difference of sodium plus potassium minus chloride plus the total CO content being less than  mEqL 
Although the use of medications with bromide has decreased  cases of bromide intoxications still occur 
It is unusual to see acute bromide intoxication  since bromide causes significant gastrointestinal irritation  resulting in nausea and vomiting  making toxic levels difficult to achieve 
Slow chronic ingestion of bromide  however  can lead to toxic levels  since bromide is excreted by the kidneys  and accumulation can occur if intake exceeds output 
The clinical features of bromide intoxication include fever  neurologic disturbances  skin rash  and history of ingesting proprietary bromide containing drugs 
Toxic manifestations include irritability  delirium  sedation  psychic disturbances  tremors  motor incoordination  and increases in CSF pressure and protein 
Spuriously increased levels of serum chloride concentration appear in bromism  but the degree of elevation is dependent on the chloride methodology employed 
There may be a poor correlation between the severity of bromide intoxication and serum bromide levels 
However  bromide intoxication will cause mental and neurologic symptoms when the serum levels of bromide exceed  mEqL 
Most patients show signs of bromide poisoning when the serum bromide concentrations are in the range of  to  mEqL
