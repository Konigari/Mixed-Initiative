Inspection consists of visual examination of the abdomen with note made of the shape of the abdomen  skin abnormalities  abdominal masses  and the movement of the abdominal wall with respiration 
Abnormalities detected on inspection provide clues to intra abdominal pathology  these are further investigated with auscultation and palpation 
Auscultation of the abdomen is performed for detection of altered bowel sounds  rubs  or vascular bruits 
Normal peristalsis creates bowel sounds that may be altered or absent by disease 
Irritation of serosal surfaces may produce a sound rub as an organ moves against the serosal surface 
Atherosclerosis may alter arterial blood flow so that a bruit is produced 
Palpation is the examination of the abdomen for crepitus of the abdominal wall  for any abdominal tenderness  or for abdominal masses 
The liver and kidneys may be palpable in normal individuals  but any other masses are abnormal 
==========
The abdomen is inspected by positioning the patient supine on an examining table or bed 
The head and knees should be supported with small pillows or folded sheets for comfort and to relax the abdominal wall musculature 
The entire abdominal wall must be examined and drapes should be positioned accordingly 
The patient's arms should be at the sides and not folded behind the head  as this tenses the abdominal wall 
Good lighting is essential  and it is helpful to have tangential lighting available  for this can create subtle shadows of abdominal wall masses 
First  the general contour of the entire abdominal wall is observed 
The contour should be checked carefully for distention and note made as to whether any distention is generalized or localized to a portion of the abdomen 
Similarly  the flanks should be checked for any bulging 
The abdominal wall skin should be inspected carefully for abnormalities 
Any areas of discoloration should be noted  such as the bluish discoloration of the umbilicus Cullen's sign or flanks Grey Turner's sign 
The skin should be inspected for striae  or stretch marks  and surgical scars 
Careful note of surgical scars should be made and correlated with the patient's recollection of previous operations 
The skin of the abdomen should also be checked carefully for engorged veins in the abdominal wall and the direction of blood flow in these veins 
This is performed by placing the tips of the index fingers together  compressing a visible vein 
The fingertips are then slid apart  maintaining compression  producing an empty venous segment between the fingers 
A finger is removed from one end and the vein is watched for filling 
The procedure is then repeated  but the opposite finger is removed and the vein again checked for filling 
Above the umbilicus  blood flow is normally upward  below the umbilicus  it is normally downward 
Obstruction of the inferior vena cava will cause reversal of flow in the lower abdomen 
In addition to these large dilated veins  note should be made of any spider angiomas of the abdominal wall skin 
Next  the abdomen should be inspected for masses 
This should be performed from several angles 
It is important to differentiate abdominal wall from intra abdominal masses 
A mass of the abdominal wall will become more prominent with tensing of the abdominal wall musculature  whereas an intra abdominal mass will become less prominent or disappear 
Useful maneuvers are to have the patient hold his head unsupported off the examining table  to hold his nose and blow  or to raise his feet off the table 
Abdominal wall masses are most commonly hernias either umbilical  epigastric  incisional  or spigelian  neoplasms benign and malignant  infections  and hematomas 
Once a mass is determined to be intra abdominal  its location should be described in relation to the abdominal quadrants Figure 
The relationship of intra abdominal organs to these quadrants should be considered in attempting to determine the cause of the mass 
The mass should be examined for movement with respiration or for pulsation with each heartbeat 
Also  the mass should be observed for peristalsis  as it may well represent dilated bowel 
Lastly  the abdominal wall should be observed for motion with respiration 
Normally  the abdominal wall moves posteriorly in a symmetrical fashion with inspiration 
With peritonitis  there may be localized or generalized rigidity of the abdominal wall so that this motion is absent 
The patient is positioned comfortably in the supine position as described in Inspection 
The stethoscope is used to listen over several areas of the abdomen for several minutes for the presence of bowel sounds 
The diaphragm of the stethoscope should be applied to the abdominal wall with firm but gentle pressure 
It is often helpful to warm the diaphragm in the examiner's hands before application  particularly in ticklish patients 
When bowel sounds are not present  one should listen for a full  minutes before determining that bowel sounds are  in fact  absent 
Auscultation for abdominal bruits is the next phase of abdominal examination 
Bruits are swishing sounds heard over major arteries during systole or  less commonly  systole and diastole 
The area over the aorta  both renal arteries 
and the iliac arteries should be examined carefully for bruits 
Rubs are infrequently found on abdominal examination but can occur over the liver  spleen  or an abdominal mass 
The patient is positioned supine with head and knees supported  as for Inspection and Auscultation 
Take the history and perform inspection and auscultation before palpation  as this tends to put the patient at ease and increases cooperation 
In addition  palpation may stimulate bowel activity and thus falsely increase bowel sounds if performed before auscultation 
Ask patients with abdominal pain to point to the area of greatest pain 
Then reassure them that you will try to minimize their discomfort and examine that point last 
In palpating the abdomen  one should first gently examine the abdominal wall with the fingertips 
This will demonstrate the crunching feeling of crepitus of the abdominal wall  a sign of gas or fluid within the subcutaneous tissues 
In addition  it will demonstrate any irregularities of the abdominal wall such as lipomas or hernias and give some idea as to areas of tenderness 
Deep palpation of the abdomen is performed by placing the flat of the hand on the abdominal wall and applying firm  steady pressure 
It may be helpful to use two handed palpation Figure    particularly in evaluating a mass 
Here the upper hand is used to exert pressure  while the lower hand is used to feel 
One should start deep palpation in the quadrant directly opposite any area of pain and carefully examine each quadrant 
At each costal margin it is helpful to have the patient inspire deeply to aid in palpation of the liver  gallbladder  and spleen 
In the flanks it is often helpful to elevate the flank to be examined slightly and place one hand on the lower ribs of that flank to push the retroperitoneal contents up to the examining hand 
In this way  small renal masses that would otherwise be missed may be appreciated 
Abdominal tenderness is the objective expression of pain from palpation 
When elicited  it should be described as to its location quadrant  depth of palpation required to elicit it superficial or deep  and the patient's response mild or severe 
Spasm or rigidity is the involuntary tightening of the abdominal musculature that occurs in response to underlying inflammation 
Guarding  in contrast  is a voluntary contraction of the abdominal wall musculature to avoid pain 
Thus  guarding tends to be generalized over the entire abdomen  whereas rigidity involves only the inflamed area 
Guarding can often be overcome by having the patient purposely relax the muscles  rigidity cannot be 
Rigidity is thus a clear cut sign of peritoneal inflammation 
Rebound tenderness is the elicitation of tenderness by rapidly removing the examining hand 
Again  this is a difficult sign for the beginning examiner to master 
The most common error is to remove the hand very quickly with an exaggerated motion and thus startle the patient 
All that needs to be done is smoothly but quickly to lift the palpating hand off the abdomen and observe for pain  facial grimace  or spasm of the abdominal wall 
Both tenderness and rebound tenderness may be elicited by palpation in a different quadrant 
Thus  palpation of the left lower quadrant may produce tenderness and rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant in appendicitis Rovsing's sign 
This is called referred tenderness and referred rebound 
When abdominal masses are palpated  the first consideration is whether the mass is intra abdominal or within the abdominal wall 
This can be determined by having the patient raise his or her head or feet from the examining table 
This will tense the abdominal muscles  thus shielding an intra abdominal mass while making an abdominal wall mass more prominent 
If the mass is intra abdominal  important points are its size  location  tenderness  and mobility 
Palpation and percussion are used to evaluate ascites 
A rounded  symmetrical contour of the abdomen with bulging flanks is often the first clue 
Palpation of the abdomen in the patient with ascites will often demonstrate a doughy  almost fluctuant sensation 
In advanced cases the abdominal wall will be tense due to distention from the contained fluid 
Gas filled intestines will float to the top of the fluid filled abdomen 
Thus  in the supine patient with ascites there should be periumbilical tympany with dullness in the flanks 
One should mark the level of dullness on the skin and then turn the patient on one side for a full minute 
A change in the level of dullness is termed shifting dullness and usually indicates more than  ml of ascitic fluid 
Another physical sign of ascites is demonstration of a transmitted fluid wave 
The patient or an assistant presses a hand firmly against the abdominal wall in the umbilical region 
The examiner places the flat of the left hand on the right flank and then taps the left flank with his right hand 
In the presence of ascites  a sharp tap will generate a pressure wave that will be transmitted to the left hand 
Unfortunately  fat will also transmit a fluid wave  and there are frequent false positives with this test 
In addition to detection of ascites  percussion can be used to help define the nature of an abdominal mass 
Tympany of an abdominal mass implies that it is gas filled i e   intestine 
Percussion is also used to define liver size 
==========
Normal peristalsis of the intestine produces bowel sounds as gas and fluid are passed through the intestinal lumen 
Normally  the bowel sounds are intermittent  low pitched  chuckling sounds 
Bowel sounds may be decreased or increased in disease states 
Ileus is a failure of peristalsis and is the normal physiologic response of the intestine to laparotomy or peritoneal inflammation 
In addition  ileus is seen in a number of disease states that do not affect the peritoneum directly  including pneumonia  congestive heart failure  and uremia 
Bowel sounds will be markedly diminished or absent in ileus as the intestine distends with gas in its paralyzed state 
Early mechanical bowel obstruction produces hyperactive peristaltic waves proximal to the mechanical obstruction 
These waves are increased in frequency and force and produce a concomitant increase in bowel sounds with characteristic rushes 
As the bowel gradually dilates with gas and fluid  the bowel sounds become high pitched and tinkling  and there may be periods of hypoactive bowel sounds that alternate with hyperperistaltic rushes 
These rushes correlate with the increased peristaltic activity 
Finally  in late intestinal obstruction there may be loss of all bowel sounds due to loss of peristaltic activity from vascular compromise 
Vascular bruits are the audible manifestation of turbulent blood flow 
They are found normally in thin patients  but in heavier individuals will be muffled because of the surrounding fat 
Loud systolic bruits are due to atherosclerotic plaques within arteries  producing turbulent flow 
These plaques are common in the aorta and iliac arteries and less common in the renal arteries 
In addition  turbulent flow within an abdominal aortic aneurysm may create a bruit 
Bruits that are present in both systole and diastole are strongly suggestive of an arteriovenous communication 
Rubs are uncommon on abdominal auscultation but  when found  are the result of inflamed peritoneal surfaces grating on each other during respiration 
This can be the result of a neoplastic or infectious process that destroys the normally smooth peritoneal surfaces 
Crepitus is produced by gas air andor fluid within tissues 
In the abdominal wall  it either is due to traumatic introduction of air or is secondary to infection gas gangrene 
Subcutaneous emphysema can occur from rupture of a pulmonary bleb or penetrating chest injury with dissection of air into the subcutaneous spaces 
In addition  penetrating abdominal trauma may introduce enough air into the abdominal wall to produce crepitus 
Gas gangrene can occur as a complication of intra abdominal surgery and produce crepitus of the abdominal wall 
The gas is produced by anaerobic bacteria usually clostridia species and is a very specific clinical sign when found in the patient with wound infection 
Abdominal tenderness occurs as a result of irritation of the parietal peritoneum 
While inflammation or irritation of the visceral peritoneum will cause abdominal discomfort  anorexia  and poorly localized pain  it will not cause tenderness and rigidity of the abdominal wall 
Irritation or inflammation of the parietal peritoneum will stimulate the pain fibers of the parietal peritoneum and abdominal wall  creating the symptoms of localized pain and the signs of tenderness  rigidity  and rebound tenderness 
Thus  if there is diffuse irritation of the peritoneum  as in diffuse peritonitis  there will be diffuse tenderness and rigidity 
Abdominal masses arise from the surrounding structures  thus the importance of topographic relationships 
The presence or absence of tenderness of a mass gives important information as to its etiology 
An appendiceal abscess will be tender as it inflames the parietal peritoneum  whereas carcinoma of the cecum will be nontender because there is no inflammation involved 
Tympany over a mass implies it is gas filled 
In the abdomen  this usually signifies the mass is dilated bowel  as only rarely will there be enough gas in any other mass to produce tympany 
Ascites is the presence of intra abdominal fluid and occurs because of overproduction of intra abdominal fluid or lack of absorption 
It is most commonly seen in cirrhosis in which there is an increase in portal pressure and hypoalbuminemia 
The increased portal pressure hydrostatically increases transudation of fluid through capillaries  whereas the hypoalbuminemia hydrostatically favors ascites formation 
Thus  there is accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal space  which signifies severe liver disease 
Other common causes of ascites include carcinomatosis in which there is both an increase in fluid formation and difficulties in clearing intraperitoneal fluid  and congestive heart failure in which there is a hydrostatic increase in venous pressure 
==========
Inspection of the abdomen gives clues to the diagnosis of intra abdominal pathology 
Combined with the patient's history  inspection can often provide a preliminary diagnosis that can be confirmed by auscultation and palpation 
Despite the current popularity of various noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tests  the experienced surgeon can usually make an accurate diagnosis of intra abdominal pathology by history and physical examination 
This is demonstrated by the patient with a several day history of right upper quadrant and back pain with associated nausea  vomiting  fever  and a visible mass in the right upper quadrant 
Such a patient almost certainly has acute cholecystitis with hydrops of the gallbladder 
The remainder of the physical examination merely confirms this and detects additional disease 
Though inspection alone never provides a clear diagnosis  it should not be overlooked 
Generalized distention of the abdomen is usually from obesity  bowel distention by gas or liquid  or ascites 
Obesity can cause generalized distension by either fat in the abdominal wall or intra abdominal fat in the omentum or viscera 
Generalized abdominal distention can also be related to ascites  particularly when associated with an everted umbilicus 
Distention of the upper half of the abdomen only may be due to pancreatic cyst or tumor or to acute gastric dilatation 
Distention of the lower half of the abdomen may be due to pregnancy  ovarian tumor  uterine fibroids  or bladder distention 
A scaphoid abdomen is due to malnutrition 
Skin abnormalities detected on inspection of the abdominal wall need to be correlated with the clinical history 
Bruising should be correlated with a history of trauma to determine the possible organs injured 
Cullen's and Grey Turner's signs bluish discoloration of the umbilicus and flanks  respectively are related to intra abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding  and it is believed the blood dissects along fascial planes to reach these areas 
Thus  one would want to question the patient diligently for causes of such bleedingsevere pancreatitis  trauma  or ruptured ectopic pregnancy 
Striae of the abdominal wall are a result of rupture of the reticular dermis that occurs with stretching 
This is seen clinically in pregnancy  obesity  ascites  abdominal carcinomatosis  and Cushing's syndrome 
Surgical scars should be examined carefully  both as to their position and their characteristics 
Often patients are unsure of what kinds of surgery they have had  but the position of the incision may give the examiner a clue 
Even though a transverse right lower quadrant incision suggests appendectomy  however  it in no way proves it  and one must be circumspect in making any such assumptions 
The scar tells the examiner about the surgery 
All scars are initially raised and red  they gradually fade to pink and by  months are generally flat and skin colored or gray 
Wounds that heal cleanly by first intention are thin and regular  whereas those that are infected and heal by secondary intention are wider and irregular 
Keloids are wide  irregular scars with abundant hypertrophic tissue outside the field of normal scarring 
Keloid formation tends to recur in certain individuals and is particularly common in blacks 
Enlarged veins are seen in three clinical situations  emaciation  portal hypertension  and inferior vena cava obstruction 
In emaciation there is loss of subcutaneous fat so that the normally invisible veins become prominent 
These veins become more prominent in the presence of portal hypertension 
In portal hypertension the umbilical vein becomes an outflow tract of the portal system and forms collaterals with the veins of the abdominal wall 
This is responsible for the caput medusa that is diagnostic of portal hypertension 
The direction of blood flow in these veins in portal hypertension is normal i e   upward in those above the umbilicus and downward in those below as the blood is flowing from the high pressure portal system to the low pressure systemic system 
Finally  the veins of the abdominal wall may be dilated due to obstruction of the inferior vena cava 
This occurs because the abdominal wall becomes a collateral  or bypass  around the obstruction of the cava 
In this situation the direction of blood flow will be reversed below the umbilicus as the blood flows from the femoral vein to the superior vena cava 
Obstruction of the inferior vena cava can occur as a result of a hepatic malignancy  as an extension of hepatic vein obstruction Budd Chiari syndrome  as a result of thrombophlebitis  or as a result of trauma or surgical intervention 
Masses noted on inspection of the abdomen may be related to organs in that area 
Thus  a mass in the right upper quadrant may represent hepatomegaly from hepatitis or hepatic tumor  a distended gallbladder from cholecystitis or pancreatic cancer  or a carcinoma in the head of the pancreas 
An epigastric mass is likely to be from acute gastric distention 
pancreatic pseudocyst  pancreatic cancer  or aneurysm of the abdominal aorta which will be pulsatile 
Masses in the left subcostal region are generally due to splenomegaly  although carcinoma of the spenic flexure of the colon is also a possibility 
Masses in the lumbar region are generally of renal origin 
Renal cysts  polycystic kidneys  and renal malignancies may all be visible in asthenic patients 
Masses in the lower quadrants may result from inflammatory or neoplastic disorders of the intestine 
In the right lower quadrant appendiceal abscess and cecal carcinoma are most likely  while in the left lower quadrant diverticular abscess or carcinoma of the sigmoid colon is most likely 
Hypogastric masses are the result of pelvic pathology 
Acute urinary retention is the most common cause of such a mass in males 
In females  uterine or ovarian neoplasms may cause visible midline abdominal masses 
Visible intestinal peristalsis is usually the result of intestinal obstruction 
This can be seen in the stomach of the newborn with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and in the small intestine of patients with small bowel obstruction from various etiologies 
Bowel sounds are of significance to the clinician as a marker of intra abdominal pathology 
The absence of bowel sounds may be one of the few indicators of intra abdominal infection in patients with multiple problems and  particularly  altered mental status 
In patients with generalized abdominal distention following laparotomy  bowel sounds may be the key diagnostic finding to differentiate ileus from early postoperative small bowel obstruction 
Though radiographic examination of the abdomen may suggest bowel obstruction  the characteristic high pitched bowel sounds are diagnostic for the experienced clinician 
Similarily  vascular bruits are helpful to the clinician as an indicator of underlying pathology 
Thus they should be carefully searched for in patients with hypertension renal artery stenosis  chronic abdominal pain mesenteric arterial insufficiency  or claudication occlusive disease of the aorta or iliac arteries 
As continuous bruits are caused by arteriovenous fistulas  they should be searched for carefully in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma 
Abdominal rubs are rare  but may be found over the liver or spleen 
A rub implies that the surface of the organ is irregular and usually is due to involvement by tumor  abscess  or infarction 
More rarely  an inflammatory intra abdominal mass may have an associated rub caused by irritation of the adjacent abdominal wall 
As mentioned previously  abdominal tenderness is a difficult physical finding to master 
Nevertheless  it is a finding that must be mastered because it is often the only clear finding in peritonitis and may well determine therapy 
The classic example of this is appendicitis 
The history and laboratory findings may suggest appendicitis in a patient with abdominal pain  but the presence or absence of tenderness makes or breaks the diagnosis 
As there are no laboratory studies that can either exclude or ensure the diagnosis of appendicitis  the clinician must make therapeutic decisions based on the physical finding of tenderness 
As tenderness is caused by inflammation of the parietal peritoneum  the etiology of tenderness can be related to the underlying organs 
Thus  right upper quadrant tenderness may be caused by cholecystitis  ulcer disease  pancreatitis  or hepatitis 
Epigastric tenderness is usually due to pancreatitis or peptic ulcer disease 
Right lower quadrant tenderness may be related to appendicitis  cecal diverticulitis  or perforated carcinoma  whereas left lower quadrant tenderness is usually due to sigmoid diverticulitis 
Flank tenderness is usually related to renal pathology  either pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess 
When tenderness is generalized  one must consider causes for generalized peritonitis 
Acute perforated ulcer is a frequent cause and presents with characteristic boardlike rigidity of the abdominal wall 
Other common causes include perforated diverticulitis  perforated appendicitis  and pancreatitis 
Nevertheless  any process that produces generalized peritoneal irritation chemical or infectious will produce the same physical findings 
Abdominal masses are related to the underlying organs 
Right upper quadrant masses include hepatomegaly  hydrops of the gallbladder  and carcinoma of the head of the pancreas 
Epigastric masses are pancreatic pseudocyst or carcinoma  gastric malignancies  and colon malignancies 
Masses in the left upper quadrant are usually due to either splenomegaly or carcinoma of the stomach or colon 
In the flanks  masses usually arise from the kidney cyst or tumor  although occasionally from other retroperitoneal structures lymphoma  sarcoma 
Masses in the lower quadrants usually arise from the bowel 
On the right side  common masses include appendiceal abscess and cecal carcinoma  on the left  diverticular abscess and sigmoid carcinoma 
Central abdominal masses are often aortic aneurysms  and the pulsatile nature of the mass is diagnostic 
Thus  in evaluating an abdominal mass  one must consider its location  mobility  and the presence or absence of tenderness in order to define its etiology 
The clinical significance of ascites is based largely on its etiology 
This can often be determined by the history and physical examination  but paracentesis is diagnostic 
Samples of peritoneal fluid should be sent to the laboratory for protein concentration  specific gravity  cell counts  and culture 
Exudative ascites occurs in bacterial peritonitis  carcinomatosis  and pancreatic ascites and is associated with a protein concentration of over  gmdl and a specific gravity above 
Transudative ascites occurs in cirrhosis  Budd Chiari syndrome  constrictive pericarditis  congestive heart failure  and hypoalbuminemic disorders such as the nephrotic syndrome 
In these incidences the protein concentration is less than  gmdl and the specific gravity less than
