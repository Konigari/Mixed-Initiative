Cyanosis is a bluish color of mucous membranes andor skin 
While this is most frequently attributable to increased amounts of unoxygenated hemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin in the vasculature  there are other causes of bluish skin color 
==========
Daylight or artificial light sources simulating daylight's spectral composition are not necessarily optimal for detecting cyanosis 
Nevertheless  consistency in observation makes it desirable that artificial light sources be similar to sunlight  since most examining areas are lighted for at least a portion of the day by sunlight 
Tungsten filament bulbs and certain fluorescent bulbs are satisfactory for this purpose 
If one is uncertain as to the adequacy of an artificial light source  use of sunlight will obviate this potential problem 
An intense light can make cyanosis less readily apparent 
One group has recommended using less than  footcandles of illumination 
As a point of reference  the standard suggested for patient rooms in Veterans Administration hospitals is  footcandles  so the recommended level of light intensity to detect cyanosis is likely to be exceeded in at least some patient examination areas 
When looking for cyanosis  one should inspect those body sites that contain minimal melanotic pigment  that have a capillary bed close to the skin surface  and that are well perfused 
Lips  ears  trunk  nailbed  hands  conjunctiva  and circumoral areas have been compared in detecting cyanosis due to arterial hypoxemia  the tongue is the most sensitive area  but the lips are more specific

Blue color can be perceived in a number of situations   when the light source directly shined on the retina has a predominant frequency in the upper shorter end of the visual spectrum   when a light source with multiple frequencies including high ones is shined on an object  absorbing all other frequencies except those at the blue end of the visual spectrum  which are reflected to the retina  and  when a white light is scattered by particles  the frequencies reflected are in the high end of the visual spectrum Tyndall effectthe blue sky is an example of this 
The normal color of flesh is thought to result from the combination of the pigments oxyhemoglobin  deoxyhemoglobin  melanin  and carotene  and from the optical effect of scattering 
The importance of the latter effect has been disputed by at least one investigator  who attributes to collagen a major role in reflecting blue wavelengths 
Blue skin coloration would result if the quantity of blue wavelengths reflected disproportionately increased or if the quantity of other wavelengths reflected disproportionately decreased 
Anyone who has observed a specimen of venous blood in a tube can confirm that it is not blue 
Thus the blue skin color detected in individuals who have increased amounts of deoxyhemoglobin cannot be explained on the basis of reflection of increased quantities of high frequency wavelengths from a blue pigment 
One plausible theory to account for the observation of cyanosis under these circumstances is that deoxyhemoglobin is less red than oxyhemoglobin and therefore absorbs more red spectrum 
By subtraction of red wavelengths  the blue spectrum is allowed to predominate in the reflected light i e   something that is less red is more blue 
The bluish skin color observed with the other pigments listed in Table 
is explained in a similar fashion 
According to Lundsgaard and Van Slyke   as well as subsequent investigators  cyanosis generally becomes apparent when the subpapillary capillaries contain from  to  gmdl of deoxyhemoglobin 
Since this measurement was difficult to obtain directly  they proposed estimating it by averaging the amount of deoxyhemoglobin in arterial blood with that in venous blood 
If one assumes a normal cardiac output  hemoglobin  and tissue extraction of O  an arterial O saturation of approximately  would be required to cause cyanosis 
It should be noted that the conclusion of Lundsgaard and Van Slyke was based on measurements of deoxyhemoglobin in peripheral venous blood and did not involve sampling of arterial blood 
Their proposal of  gmdl deoxyhemoglobin in mean capillary blood as a threshold for detecting cyanosis has not been confirmed or refuted by more sophisticated techniques 
Reduced arterial oxygenation can result if the amount of oxygen in the alveoli is lowered or if the gradient between the alveolar oxygen and the arterial oxygen is elevated 
One can determine which of these is the explanation by measuring the arterial partial pressure of oxygen Pao and calculating the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen PAo and the a a O gradient with the following formulas 
where 
PB = barometric pressure 
Pho° = partial pressure water vapor at °C  mm Hg 
Fo = fraction of inspired air that is oxygen 
PAco = partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood 
R = respiratory quotient VcoVo  generally about 
Even with normal arterial oxygenation  cyanosis can occur when there is increased extraction of oxygen at the capillary level because the average of arterial and venous oxygen saturation will be lower 
Reduced flow through capillaries results in increased tissue extraction of oxygen and therefore increased amounts of deoxyhemoglobin  favoring the appearance of cyanosis 
In anemic patients  much more profound decreases in tissue oxygen levels are required to produce  gmdl of deoxyhemoglobin in capillary blood 
For example  with a hemoglobin of 
gmdl  capillary blood would have to have a Po of about  mm Hg  sat   contrasted with a Po of about  mm Hg  sat 
for a hemoglobin of  gmdl 
Hemoglobins that have an abnormally low affinity for oxygen high P have decreased amounts of hemoglobin bound with oxygen at usual levels of Pao 
Cyanosis can result on occasion 
A tube of blood containing excess methemoglobin is reddish brown to brown in color and remains so even after shaking in air or  O 
Methemoglobin is an oxidized hemoglobin in which iron is in the ferric form 
It does not bind oxygen 
Some methemoglobin is normally formed in the body  but this is usually reduced to deoxyhemoglobin by the NADH methemoglobin reductase system 
If this enzyme system is deficient or if it becomes overloaded by excess amounts of methemoglobin  elevated blood levels of methemoglobin result 
In some patients with congenitally abnormal hemoglobins Hgb Ms the structure of the hemoglobin makes the heme unit susceptible to rapid oxidation 
The level of methemoglobin capable of producing cyanosis is said to be about 
gmdl  although this value seems to have been less carefully scrutinized than that for deoxyhemoglobin 
As with methemoglobin  a tube of blood containing sufficient sulfhemoglobin has a reddish brown color that does not change upon shaking in  O 
Sulfhemoglobin is a pigment not normally formed in the body 
Its chemical composition is not well defined  although it has the spectrophotometric characteristic of strongly absorbing light at  nm in the presence of cyanide 
The mechanism of formation is not known  although many of the same toxins that result in the oxidation of deoxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin can also produce sulfhemoglobin 
The explanation for the formation of sulfhemoglobin in one individual and methemoglobin in another exposed to the same toxin is not known 
Once formed  the sulfhemoglobin molecule is stable and is not converted back to deoxyhemoglobin 
Cyanosis is reported to be detectable at sulfhemoglobin levels as low as 
gmdl 
Methemalbumin  which produces a brown plasma  is a pigment formed by the union of albumin in the plasma with hemin 
The pigment may be present in the blood when excessive breakdown of red cells results in saturation of haptoglobin with hemoglobin 
Dissolution of the remaining free hemoglobin into globin and heme can occur 
Heme is immediately oxidized to hematin and in the presence of chloride forms hemin  which complexes with albumin 
The minimal amount of resulting methemalbumin required to produce cyanosis is not stated in the literature 
==========
Cyanosis as a tool for detecting arterial hypoxemia is neither sensitive nor specific 
Comroe and Botelho  studied a group of normal subjects breathing various concentrations of oxygen 
Definite cyanosis was not apparent to  of observers even at arterial oxygen saturations of  to  Pao  to  mm Hg 
In contrast   and  of the observers believed definite cyanosis to be present when arterial oxygen saturations were  to  and  to   respectively 
In the same study progressive hypoxemia was induced in a subject and one physician first noted definite cyanosis at arterial oxygen saturations of       and  in consecutive trials on this same subject within a period of  minutes 
The sensitivity of this sign is lessened when examining deeply pigmented individuals 
In blacks   to  more arterial oxygen desaturation may be required for detection of cyanosis 
To confirm that arterial hypoxemia is responsible for cyanosis  a blood specimen must be analyzed for Pao 
When a reduction is found  one must consider the causes listed in Table 
When cyanosis is due to arterial hypoxemia  other signs and symptoms are usually present 
Peripheral chemoreceptors may be stimulated by a low Pao  causing increased ventilation with dyspnea and tachypnea 
Sympathetic nervous system stimulation produces restlessness  sweating  elevation of blood pressure  and tachycardia 
When hypoxemia is severe and cerebral oxygenation is impaired  confusion or coma can occur 
As demonstrated in a number of studies  severe hypoxemia may be present at times when cyanosis is not readily detectable either because of observer insensitivity or confounding factors in the patient  such as heavy melanin pigmentation or anemia 
The importance of arterial blood gas analysis in detecting hypoxemia cannot be overemphasized 
The usual pattern of cyanosis noted in conditions of reduced blood flow is for peripheral sites  in particular the extremities  to be affected preferentially acrocyanosis 
Central portions of the body are typically spared 
Low flow may result from decreased arterial perfusion caused by poor cardiac output as in cardiogenic shock  by fixed arterial narrowing as in atherosclerosis  or by reflex arteriolar narrowing as in cold weather 
Venous obstruction slows capillary blood flow and may be caused by local venous thrombosis or central congestive heart failure mechanisms 
More than  hemoglobins with low oxygen affinities have been described 
With most of them there are few clinical manifestations apart from cyanosis 
Since loading hemoglobin with oxygen is not affected  whereas unloading oxygen from hemoglobin is facilitated  tissue oxygen is high  and suppression of erythropoietin may produce a mild anemia 
Deficiency of the NADH methemoglobin reductase system is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern 
Even though  to  rnethemoglobin may be present  affected individuals generally have only cyanosis as a clinical manifestation 
Oxidation of deoxyhemoglobin to form methemoglobin can be caused by many drugs and toxins including nitrites  sulfonamides  and aniline derivatives 
It is unusual for symptoms to accompany the cyanosis  although  with levels of methemoglobin greater than  to   cardiovascular collapse  coma  and death have occurred 
The five variants of Hgb M are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern 
Individuals in whom an alpha chain substitution has occurred are noted to be cyanotic beginning at birth 
Those in whom beta chain substitution has occurred often do not become cyanotic until three to six months of age because of the normal changeover from gamma to beta chain synthesis during that time 
Cyanosis is usually the only clinical manifestation in any of the variants 
Individuals who experience no symptoms with up to  gmdl sulfhemoglobinemia have been described 
Since sulfhemoglobin is stable  the rate of resolution of cyanosis following a toxic exposure is slow  as degradation of sulfhemoglobin becomes dependent on the life span of the red cell 
This contrasts to cases of toxic methemoglobin formation in which the transiently overloaded NADH methemoglobin reductase system rapidly reduces methemoglobin following the removal of the toxin 
Because the formation of methemalbumin is dependent on large scale destruction of red cells  hemolytic states or large extravascular accumulations of blood are the most common associated conditions 
Ingestion of substances containing gold or silver can produce bluish skin coloration that is most prominent in sun exposed portions of the body 
The bluish skin color associated with hemosiderin deposition is more apparent in parts of the body with less melanotic pigment 
A more bronze color is seen in the presence of melanin 
Polymers of the oxidation products of chlorpromazine  when deposited in the skin and other organs  can result in a blue to purple color 
A new antiarrhythmic agent  amiodarone  can cause lipofuscin deposition in the skin 
In sun exposed areas  a blue skin color is seen in a small percentage of patients on long term therapy 
One approach to assessing the etiology of cyanosis is to obtain a heparinized arterial blood specimen 
If the sample is dark red and becomes bright red on shaking in air  one should perform blood gas analysis on another specimen to confirm arterial hypoxemia 
If the specimen obtained is brown and does not change color on shaking in air  the plasma should be allowed to separate 
If the plasma is brown  methemalbumin is likely to be present 
If the plasma is clear  one should suspect the presence of methemoglobin or sulfhemoglobin 
A bright red arterial specimen obtained in a patient with generalized blue skin color should lead one to suspect deposition of nonheme pigment in the skin
