Indigestion is a term commonly used by patients and physicians to indicate some form of gastrointestinal tract upset 
It includes a wide variety of symptoms  which in turn may be manifestations of a wide variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal diseases 
Often these symptoms prove to be a reflection of gastroduodenal dysfunction secondary to stress 
The words indigestion and dyspepsia may be used interchangeably  usually to describe one or more symptoms experienced shortly after eating  simply implying a disorder of the digestive processes 
Among such symptoms are postprandial nausea and occasionally emesis  upper abdominal bloating  fullness  or discomfort  belching and flatulence  and  less commonly  a bad taste in the mouth  a coated tongue  fatigue  somnolence  or headache 
Occasionally patients use the term indigestion to describe the symptoms of heartburn  heartburn  however  is defined more specifically as a substernal burning sensation of variable intensity that may extend toward the neck or base of the throat 
==========
Understand the patient's symptoms 
What does the patient mean by the terms indigestion and heartburn 
If the patient complains of indigestion  specifically which symptoms are present 
Is there postprandial nausea 
If vomiting has occurred  what is the nature of the vomitus 
What is its volume 
Is it acidic 
Is it bilious 
Does it contain undigested food 
Does it contain fresh or altered blood 
Does it have other unusual characteristics 
Does the patient have upper abdominal bloating  fullness  or discomfort 
Are belching and flatulence prominent 
Does the patient complain of a bad taste in the mouth or coated tongue 
Has the patient experienced fatigue  somnolence  or headache 
Does the patient have heartburn but call it indigestion? 
After the symptoms have been clarified  inquiry should be directed toward an understanding of their genesis 
When did these symptoms begin 
Are they constant or intermittent 
What precipitates them 
What affords relief 
If intermittent  how long do they last 
What pattern  if any  do they show 
Do they follow meals 
Do they occur after specific food or drink 
Do they relate to taking some new medication 
Do they occur with activity 
Do they change with position 
Do they relate to bowel activity 
If pain is present  what is its location and intensity? 
What are the patient's dietary habits 
Are meals skipped 
Are suppers unusually large 
Does the patient drink excessive alcohol  coffee  or cola drinks  or smoke cigarettes 
Does the patient chew his food well  or is he or she edentulous 
Does the patient lie down soon after eating 
Are the meals eaten on the run or in a relaxed manner 
Are there ongoing unusual  stressful life situations or emotional conflicts 
Are symptoms associated with identifiable stressful situations? 
With respect to indigestion  inquire about symptoms of  and search for signs of  a variety of gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal disorders because the differential diagnostic considerations are extensive 
With heartburn  inquire about occasionally associated acidic or bilious regurgitation  dysphagia  odynophagia  and chest pain  the last being a symptom of diffuse esophageal spasm 
In patients having complaints of indigestion andor heartburn  thorough inquiry into underlying psychosocial factors is of major importance because emotional stress and conflict frequently prove causative 
Symptoms may be augmented further by the patient's anxiety about his or her physical well being 
Only after appropriate diagnostic studies have reassured the patient and the physician can both parties begin to deal effectively with an underlying emotional basis for the patient's symptoms 
==========
Postprandial upper abdominal fullness may result from excessive intake of food or drink  especially of carbonated beverages  but the complaint of indigestion more likely is the consequence of aerophagia with gastric distention or of delayed gastric emptying  the latter secondary to mechanical or motor disturbance 
Occasionally  large esophageal diverticula  esophageal strictures malignant or benign  or esophageal motor disturbances as seen in achalasia or scleroderrna may result in similar postprandial fullness  which may be described as indigestion 
Preceding gastric resectional surgery for the treatment of gastric malignancy or peptic ulcer may significantly reduce gastric capacity  again resulting in postprandial fullness or indigestion 
Associated bilious reflux also may be symptomatic 
The stomach can be thought of as two functional units  the proximal reservoir fundus and body and the distal pumping area of mixing and emptying antrum 
The pylorus is a low pressure sphincter that prevents large particles of food from exiting  it also prevents reflux of duodenal content into the stomach 
Liquids exit the stomach faster than solids 
Delivery of gastric content into the duodenum is dependent on the presence of a  cycle per minute electrical control activity  with periodic antral contractions occurring in response to a second electrical event known as the electrical response activity 
The entire process is governed by complex neural and humoral factors 
The rate of gastric emptying may be inhibited by meals of high osmotic pressure or high fat content  with inhibitory receptors probably located in the duodenum and proximal jejunum 
Studies of Hunt and Stubbs  have yielded data indicating that nutritive density kilocalories per milliliter rather than initial volume determines the rate of gastric emptying 
Isocaloric amounts of fat  protein  and carbohydrate apparently cause equal slowing of gastric emptying 
Inhibitory activity is mediated by neural and hormonal mechanisms  and  presumably  by their interactions 
Metabolic products of ingested food also may play a role 
The relative importance of neural and hormonal factors in the regulation of gastric emptying remains uncertain 
The gastrointestinal hormones gastrin  secretin  and CCK PZ all inhibit gastric emptying 
GIP gastric inhibitory peptide and VIP vasoactive intestinal peptide also retard gastric emptying  whereas motilin increases gastric motility 
Enterogastrone  a crude intestinal extract liberated from the duodenum by micellar fat exposure  also inhibits gastric emptying 
Sympathetic  vagal  and other inhibitory gastric innervation are involved in retarding gastric emptying 
Examples of diseases in which mechanical pyloric obstruction accounts for delays in gastric emptying include tumors  peptic ulcer disease  and idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis 
Examples of conditions in which acute or chronic delays in gastric emptying are observed in the absence of mechanical obstruction are given in Table 
The causes of the impaired gastric emptying in many of these conditions remain incompletely understood 
Gastric emptying may be altered variably by vagotomy and a variety of surgical procedures  which sometimes lead to dumping  but occasionally lead to chronic gastric retention with nutritional compromise and occasional formation of bezoars 
Atrophic gastritis  gastric ulcer  and gastric cancer sometimes are associated with delayed gastric emptying by mechanisms that are obscure 
Medications of a wide variety cause symptoms of indigestion by presumed direct gastric irritation e g   acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  by central effects e g   morphine  and by anticholinergic effects or side effects e g   atropine  various antispasmodics  and phenothiazines 
Bloating  one of the common complaints of the patient with indigestion  may be attributable to gastrointestinal gas 
The latter is derived from swallowed air and from gut bacterial metabolism 
Postprandial bloating and belching often are related to aerophagia  sometimes a habit of anxious individuals  occasionally aggravated by the ingestion of carbonated beverages or by gum chewing 
Complaints of bloating and flatulence are common in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome  apparently the result of an underlying motility disturbance and decreased pain threshold and not the result of qualitative or quantative differences in intestinal gas formation in comparison to normal controls  as clarified by Lasser  Bond  and Levitt 
Heartburn  the most frequent symptom of gastroesophageal reflux  is experienced variably in response to esophagitis caused by the reflux of irritant acid peptic or  occasionally  alkaline gastric or gastroduodenal content 
Presumably such reflux is most often the consequence of an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter LES  a manometrically demonstrable segment of high pressure normally maintained at the junction of the esophagus with the stomach 
Factors influencing gastroesophageal reflux and its effects include the competency of the LES  the volume of gastric content  the quantity and corrosiveness of the refluxed material  the clearance of this material by the esophagus  and local esophageal tissue resistance 
Delayed gastric emptying also may contribute to symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux in some patients 
Patients may experience increased heartburn after overeating or after recumbency following meals  after eating spicy foods  fatty foods  or chocolate  after drinking citrus juices  cola drinks  coffee  or alcohol  or after smoking 
Some of the preceding cause a reduction in lower esophageal sphincter pressure  with presumed consequent increased gastroesophageal reflux 
Anticholinergic medications may have similar effects 
While alkaline reflux esophagitis may be observed in some patients without preceding gastric resectional surgery  such operations as well as gastroenterostomy particularly predispose to this problem 
==========
A sense of fullness  bloating  or upper abdominal discomfort and distention after meals  or  in common parlance  indigestion  suggests aerophagia andor impaired or delayed gastric emptying 
The former usually is a nervous habit  the latter usually is the result of mechanical pyloric or gastric outlet obstruction or is secondary to a multitude of nonmechanical causes  including emotional factors 
Delay in gastric emptying may be evidenced by obvious gastric distention on physical examination or plain abdominal x rays  by emesis of undigested food many hours after its consumption  or by apparent retained food in the stomach as noted at the time of upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies or upper endoscopy 
It may be assessed by means of radiopaque meals or by intubation sampling or isotope studies 
The most common causes of mechanical pyloric or gastric outlet obstruction are tumors polyps  carcinoma  narrowing secondary to acute inflammation and edema or chronic scarring from peptic ulcer disease  and idiopathic pyloric hypertrophy 
Other neoplastic or infiltrative processes involving the stomach primarily e g   carcinoma  gastroduodenal Crohn's disease or secondarily e g   pancreatic carcinoma also may cause gastric outlet obstruction 
The most common causes of nonmechanical gastric retention include both gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal conditions such as those listed in Table 
Diseases as diverse as scleroderma and acute gastroenteritis also may result in delayed gastric emptying 
The other and perhaps largest group of patients with indigestion has anxiety and stress as the chief determinants of this so called psychophysiologic gastrointestinal reaction 
In this group  extensive clinical evaluation yields no apparent organic explanation for symptoms 
Heartburn usually is the result of acid or alkaline gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis 
Gastroesophageal reflux can be demonstrated by means of barium studies  by manometric placement of a pH probe  or by radioisotope study 
When the patient gives a classic description of heartburn  further study rarely is needed 
When one is uncertain of the source of the patient's symptoms  the Bernstein test can be done 
Briefly stated  this test monitors the patient's response to acid perfusion of the esophagus 
This test often is helpful  but by no means is it always conclusive 
Endoscopic findings of esophagitis run the gamut from imperceptible grossly  to erythema  to frank erosions and exudates  and even to ulceration and stricture formation 
Suction biopsies of esophageal mucosa may demonstrate thickening of the basal layer and elongation of the dermal pegs which may extend nearly to the mucosal surface 
Manometric measurements of the lower esophageal sphincter tend to be low in most patients with gastroesophageal reflux  however  some patients with normal pressures may have symptoms of reflux  and some patients with low pressures may not 
As in the case of many patients with indigestion  extensive studies in patients complaining of heartburn also may prove unrevealing 
Nevertheless  such comprehensive evaluation may serve as the basis of an effective therapeutic approach to the large group of patients whose symptoms are emotionally based 
Coronary artery disease producing angina is often described by patients as indigestion  heartburn  or a sense of fullness 
A valuable clue is the association of the duration with exertion and its relief with rest
