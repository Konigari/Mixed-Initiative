Organic impotence refers to the inability to obtain an erection firm enough for vaginal penetration  or the inability to sustain the erection until completion of intercourse 
In contrast to psychogenic impotence  which is impotence caused by anxiety  guilt  depression  or conflict around various sexual issues  organic impotence  the more common of the two categories of erectile dysfunction  is caused by physical problems 
Ten to  of middle aged men and a much higher percentage of elderly men are impotent 
Aside from its importance as a common and distressing sexual problem  organic impotence may herald important medical problems 
==========
The first step in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction is to determine whether it is due to organic or psychogenic causes 
This usually requires clinical and laboratory data 
Specialized tests become important when specific diagnoses are considered 
The history can be useful in distinguishing organic from psychogenic impotence Table 
The patient with organic impotence describes problems with erection that progress over months to years 
At first  the patient will have partial erections or seemingly firm erections that become flaccid during intercourse 
With time  total erectile failure ensues 
Organic impotence is constant and nonselective  meaning it is not better or worse with any specific partner or any type of stimulation 
By contrast  psychogenic impotence typically is abrupt in onset  often in relation to psychological trauma  and may wax and wane 
Patients with psychogenic impotence may have total erectile failure with one partner but not another  or be impotent during sexual intercourse but not during self stimulation 
Normally occurring spontaneous erections in the morning suggest psychogenic rather than organic causes for impotence 
For the patient whose history suggests organic impotence  further history  physical and laboratory data will help identify the cause 
The classification listed in Table 
is based on the pathophysiologic scheme presented above  and includes mechanical problems that can interfere with erection 
Vascular disease is the most common cause of impotence 
In advanced cases  Lehriche's syndrome of aortoiliac occlusion will be suggested by bilateral thigh or calf claudication  loss of muscle mass in the buttocks and legs  and impotence 
However  the majority of patients with vascular impotence have less severe vascular disease and many will have occlusive disease of the hypogastric cavernous bed only 
Even among patients without claudication  vascular disease is still a likely cause of impotence  especially if risk factors for atherosclerosis are present 
Nonatherosclerotic disease is a consideration in the patient with a history of trauma or radiation to the pelvis  both of which cause fibrosis of vessels 
While impotence may be the presenting symptom of vascular disease  in neurologic disease impotence generally occurs in the setting of an obvious nervous system disorder  typically in patients known to have spinal cord pathology or neuropathy 
Impotent patients should be questioned about decreased genital sensation  which would suggest diabetic  alcoholic  or other forms of neuropathy  weakness  which may accompany multiple sclerosis or spinal cord tumors  and back pain  bowel  and bladder symptoms  which raise concern for cauda equina syndrome 
A careful drug history is important in the evaluation of impotence 
Drugs that cause impotence Table 
generally do so by interfering with neurotransmission 
Endocrine problems  though uncommon  should be considered in patients presenting with impotence 
As a rule  impotence due to hypogonadism will be partial and accompanied by decreased libido 
Hypothalmic pituitary problems  which include tumors  are the most common endocrine disorders causing impotence  followed by primary gonadal failure from one of many causes 
Poorly controlled diabetes with polyuria and polydypsia is an important reversible cause of impotence  as is hyperthyroidism 
Certain drugs  alcohol included  can lead to impotence as a result of endocrine disturbances 
Finally  the history may suggest one of several mechanical causes of impotence such as Peyronie's disease and congenital or acquired abnormalities of the penis 
Examination of the vascular system is particularly relevant to the evaluation of the impotent patient 
Absence of pulses in the feet and presence of femoral bruits suggest atherosclerosis 
However  normal femoral and pedal pulses do not exclude selective obstruction to penile blood flow 
Direct palpation of the dorsal artery of the penis may be informative if pulsation is absent 
The presence of a pulse  however  does not rule out vascular disease  particularly in a patient who is able to achieve normal erections at rest  but unable to maintain them during thrusting 
At the same time that the penile pulses are palpated  the examiner should feel for plaques in the corpora cavernosa which would indicate Peyronie's disease 
Neurologic impotence is suggested by the absence of sensation in the sacral dermatomes when tested by pinprick  or by neurologic abnormalities elsewhere 
The bulbocavernosus reflex may be assumed to be present if anal sphincter tone is normal on rectal examination 
If there is doubt  the reflex can be tested by pinching the glans penis and assessing sphincter contraction during the rectal examination 
Hypogonadism may be suggested by the patient's general appearance 
If testosterone deficiency antedates puberty  as in Klinefelter's syndrome  eunuchoid proportionsdefined as an arm span  cm or more in excess of height  or a sole to pubis length exceeding crown to pubis length by more than  cmmay be present 
In postpubertal males whose testosterone levels are markedly depressed  the secondary sexual characteristics may become atrophic 
Testicles less than  cm in length or a prostate gland that is smaller than expected may be the only clues on physical examination to a pituitary tumor with secondary hypogonadism

Erection is a vascular event 
The penis becomes rigid when blood flow to the corpora cavernosa increases sixfold and venous outflow is physiologically impeded 
Penile perfusion is governed by three organ systemsthe neurologic  circulatory  and endocrinologic systemseach necessary for potency 
The neurologic system accounts for vasodilation and venoconstriction of the corporal blood vessels so that blood is shunted to the erectile tissues  the circulatory system provides adequate blood flow to the hypogastric cavernous bed  a distal branch off the internal iliac vessels  and the endocrine system  mediated by testosterone  plays a permissive role through mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated 
The neurologic pathways required for erection originate in the cerebral cortex where visual  auditory  and psychic stimuli are processed  and in the pudenal nerve  an afferent nerve that transmits tactile sensations from the genitals to the sacral segments of the spinal cord and cortex 
Efferent signals from the spinal cord pass along the pelvic parasympathetic nerves and dilate the corporal vessels 
The specific neurotransmitters have not been fully defined  acetylcholine  and perhaps vasoactive intestinal peptide  appears to be important 
There are many causes of neurogenic impotence 
Anything that disrupts neural pathways or blocks neurochemical transmission will have an adverse effect on erection 
Psychologic factors probably interfere with erection by inhibiting corticosacral efferent pathways 
The circulatory system plays a central role in obtaining and sustaining erections 
Augmentation of blood flow to the corporal bodies depends on the intravascular pressure in the penile artery 
Vascular lesionstypically atherosclerotic  but occasionally fibroticand systemic hypotension will limit flow to the corpora 
In certain patients  blood flow at rest may be sufficient to obtain an erection but not sufficient to maintain it during intercourse  when the pelvic musculature places greater demands on a compromised blood supply 
Testosterone is necessary for normal libido and plays a permissive role in potency 
Hypogonadism  as seen in primary testicular problems or pituitary hypothalmic abnormalities  is associated with impotence that improves with androgen replacement 
==========
An approach to the diagnosis and management of the impotent patient is presented in Figure 
Apparent and likely causes of impotence should be considered first and  if possible  eliminated before the work up continues 
For instance  observing the patient for a few weeks off offending medication may be all that is necessary to establish the cause of impotence 
When no obvious or remediable cause is present  the next step is based on the clinical impression of the likelihood of organic versus psychologic impotence 
If the latter is considered more likely  it is perfectly reasonable to refer the patient directly for sexual therapy  with the option of reconsidering the diagnosis if  after appropriate therapy  there is no improvement 
While an occasional patient with organic impotence will be misrouted  many more with psychogenic impotence will be spared an unnecessary and costly evaluation for organic causes 
When organic impotence is likely  a serum testosterone level is the initial screening test for hypogonadism and should be obtained prior to urologic referral 
Patients with low testosterone levels require further endocrine evaluations as depicted in Figure 
In the majority of patients the impotence is organic  though not endocrinologic  and there is no easily remedied cause 
These patients require physiologic testing and urologic consultation for specific diagnosis 
Likely causes of impotence in this group include vascular and neurologic diseases 
These patients are candidates for penile prostheses or  in special cases  for revascularization 
Patients interested in surgical approaches should be referred for further testing 
There is little to be gained by continuing the work up of patients who prefer not to have an operation 
If surgical intervention is an acceptable option  the work up then proceeds with a noctural penile tumescense NPT test  the single most valuable study to establish the diagnosis of organic impotence 
The NPT test exploits the fact that males from birth to old age normally have erections during rapid eye movement REM sleep 
Psychogenic impotence is associated with normal erections during sleep 
In organic impotence there should be no evidence of erection or  if erections are present  they should be limited and poorly sustained 
Penile blood flow is measured using a Doppler probe and a 
cm blood pressure cuff 
Systolic pressures in the right and left corpora cavernosa are measured and the penile brachial index is calculated taking a ratio of penile systolic pressure to brachial systolic pressure 
These measures should be repeated before and after  minutes of exercising the pelvic and leg muscles 
In normal men  the PBI should be 
or greater 
Ratios between 
and 
suggest vascular impotence  a ratio below 
is diagnostic 
Pelvic arteriography can be done if revascularization is considered 
Measurement of the penile vibration perception threshold provides an inexpensive  reproducible  and painless screening test with acceptable sensitivity for detecting neuropathy 
Abnormalities at the level of the sacral cord can be documented by sacral latency testing  while upper motor neuron impotence can be demonstrated with genital cerebral evoked response testing 
These latter procedures are not indicated in unselected patients with impotence 
Treatment of impotence due to hypogonadism is parenteral testosterone replacement 
Management of patients in whom impotence is caused by a pituitary tumor is directed at the tumor 
Drug related impotence is managed by withdrawing the offending agent or  if that is not possible  reducing the dosage 
Almost all drugs that cause impotence do so in a dosage related fashion 
A hypertensive patient who is impotent while taking  g daily of methyldopa may regain potency on  g daily of methyldopa and a second drug 
The prognosis is favorable for alcohol related impotence 
Most patients who stop drinking or reduce their consumption to more moderate levels will see their impotence improve 
Exceptions tend to be those who have developed hepatic cirrhosis with gonadal atrophy and feminization 
In diabetics  impotence that develops acutely in the setting of hyperglycemia and poor metabolic control is usually reversible 
This is not true of the slowly progressive impotence of long standing diabetes that is a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy 
Intracavernosal self injection of vasoactive drugs such as papaverine  which relaxes arteriolar smooth muscle is a promising new approach to treatment that is particularly suited for diabetic patients whose erectile dysfunction is on a neuropathic basis 
It also has been used with success in spinal cord patients 
The penile prosthesis is suitable treatment for most patients with vascular impotence 
While there is currently considerable interest in revascularization techniques  insertion of a semirigid rod  such as the Jones prosthesis  remains the most commonly performed procedure
