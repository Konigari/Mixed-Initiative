Uric acid is the ultimate catabolite of purine metabolism in humans and higher primates 
It is a weak organic acid that under physiologic conditions exists mainly as a monosodium salt 
At a pH less than    as may occur in the urine  the predominant form is nonionized uric acid 
The solubility of monosodium urate is about  times greater than uric acid in aqueous solutions 
This solubility differential provides the therapeutic rationale for alkalinization of the urine pH to greater than 
in patients forming uric acid stones 
The upper limit of plasma uric acid may be defined by a statistical range in a normal population 
Epidemiologic studies in the United States have generally accepted 
mgdl as the upper limit in adult men and 
mgdl in women 
The physiochemical definition of hyperuricemia may be considered 
mgdl measured by the specific uricase method 
This represents the solubility limit of urate in plasma at Â°C 
Levels beyond 
result in supersaturated solutions that are prone to crystal formation 
Uric acid levels are influenced by age and sex 
Prior to puberty  the average serum uric acid is 
mgdl for males and females 
Following puberty  values rise to adult levels with women typically  mgdl less than men 
This lower level in women apparently reflects estrogen related enhancement of renal urate clearance and disappears at the menopause 
Many additional factors  including exercise  diet  drugs  and state of hydration  may result in transient fluctuations of uric acid levels

Currently  two methods are widely utilized to quantify uric acid 
A colorimetric method depends on the reduction of a chromogen such as sodium tungstate by uric acid to produce a measurable color change 
This technique has been commonly employed in automated hospital screening SMA systems 
The method measures materials other than urate  such as ascorbic acid 
Colorimetric determinations are generally considered an overestimation of true uric acid levels  and the normal range is usually  mgdl higher than the more specific enzymatic techniques 
Enzymatic determination of uric acid results from the specific oxidation of uric acid by uricase  which converts its substrate to allantoin 
The differential absorbance of these substances at  nm allows quantification 
Although traditionally a more expensive technique  uricase methods are currently available for SMA systems at comparable costs and are gradually replacing the less specific colorimetric method

Serum uric acid reflects the interactions of four major processes  dietary purine intake  endogenous purine metabolism  urinary urate excretion  and intestinal uricolysis 
The typical American diet may provide a significant purine load 
Humans do not depend on exogenous purines to serve as precursors of tissue nucleic acids  and nearly all of this dietary component is directly converted into uric acid 
Xanthine oxidase  the enzyme responsible for conversion of oxypurines to uric acid  is found in abundance in the liver and the mucosa of the small intestine 
Most dietary nucleic acids are ingested in the form of nucleoproteins and can be metabolized to uric acid at the level of the gut mucosa 
Dietary manipulation was once the mainstay of antihyperuricemic therapy 
Nevertheless  even rigid purine free diets result in only modest reductions of serum uric acid  generally in the range of  mgdl 
The advent of potent antihyperuricemic drugs has resulted in diminished emphasis on the therapeutic role of diet 
Nonetheless  certain foods  such as organ meats  are rich in purines and can cause a significant flux in serum uric acid if ingested in sufficient quantities 
Endogenous purines are derived from de novo biosynthesis and breakdown of tissue nucleic acids 
Measurement of the true rate of endogenous purine turnover requires isotopic dilution techniques carried out on patients severely restricted in dietary purines 
A more practical approach in patients with normal renal function who are not taking uricosuric agents involves the measurement of a  hour urine collection for uric acid 
This provides a crude estimate of the rate of purine production 
On purine restricted diets  a commonly accepted upper limit of uric acid excretion is  mg hr 
On an unrestricted diet  the limit is raised to  mg hr 
A minority of patients with primary hyperuricemia excrete excessive amounts of uric acid 
In only a small fraction of these patients has a specific regulatory enzyme defect been identified 
Hyperuricemia secondary to hematologic diseases characterized by increased cellular turnover  such as hemolytic and myeloproliferative disorders  are associated with increased urinary excretion of uric acid 
The accelerated turnover of nucleic acids in these disorders results in a compensatory increase in the rate of purine biosynthesis 
Finally  certain exogenous substances  such as methylene blue and fructose  may stimulate purine biosynthesis 
The kidney is the major site for removal of uric acid and accounts for two thirds to three fourths of the daily losses 
Urate excretion is believed to depend on a system that includes four components  glomerular filtration  proximal tubular reabsorption  secretion  and postsecretory reabsorption 
In primary hyperuricemia and gout  most patients demonstrate a defect in the renal handling of uric acid 
In theory  failure of any of the model's components could be involved in the development of hyperuricemia in these patients 
At present  the exact site of the defect remains unresolved 
Diminished glomerular filtration rate and renal failure can lead to secondary hyperuricemia 
Diuretics increase serum uric acid by multiple mechanisms including an increase in tubular reabsorption 
The secretory mechanism for uric acid may be inhibited by a number of organic acids including lactate  betahydroxybutyrate  and acetoacetate 
This accounts  in part  for the hyperuricemia seen in diabetic ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis 
Salicylates in low dose less than 
gmday impair the secretory mechanism and raise serum uric acid levels 
Higher doses inhibit urate absorption  producing a urate diuresis and reduction in serum uric acid 
About one quarter to one third of uric acid is normally disposed of by intestinal uricolysis carried out by enzymes of the gut bacterial flora 
Uric acid reaches the intestines through alimentary secretions including saliva  bile  gastric  pancreatic  and intestinal juices 
Hyperuricemia secondary to failure of intestinal uricolysis has not been recognized 
The role of intestinal degradation expands in patients with renal insufficiency and may account for as much as  of urate elimination

Hyperuricemia may be conveniently divided into two major categories 
Symptomatic hyperuricemia is manifested by gout  nephrolithiasis  and uric acid nephropathy 
A larger group of patients have asymptomatic hyperuricemia 
Some of these patients will eventually become symptomatic 
The risk of acute gouty arthritis increases with the level of serum uric acid and the duration of hyperuricemia 
Acute fluctuations in serum uric acid may be associated with the precipitation of acute gouty arthritis 
Sudden reductions in serum uric acid may accompany the introduction of antihyperuricemic therapy  hence  these patients often simultaneously begin prophylactic doses of colchicine 
Nephrolithiasis may accompany gouty arthropathy or occur as an independent problem 
Uric acid forms radiolucent stones or may contribute to the formation of calcium stones 
In patients with gout  the risk of stone formation rises with the level of serum uric acid 
A better correlation exists between stone formation and urinary uric acid excretion 
One study found the prevalence of stones to be  in gouty patients excreting greater than  mg of uric acid per  hours 
Acute uric acid nephropathy results from the precipitation of uric acid crystals within the collecting tubules and ureters 
It is a severe form of acute renal failure and is classically associated with the chemotherapy of leukemias and lymphomas 
It may also occur following strenuous exercise and epileptic seizures 
Hyperuricosuria  aciduria  and urine concentration seem to act in concert to produce this syndrome 
The diagnosis can be made by the demonstration of a uric acid to creatinine ratio greater than  in the setting of acute renal failure 
Routine screening of hospitalized patients will identify a substantial number with elevated serum uric acid and no related symptoms 
Most of these patients will remain asymptomatic throughout their lives 
A complete discussion of the management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia is beyond the scope of this chapter 
Suffice it to say that the weight of current evidence speaks against the normalization of uric acid in asymptomatic patients 
Regardless of the level of uric acid  little seems to be lost by awaiting the onset of the first bout of arthritis or kidney stone 
Hypouricemia is commonly defined as a serum urate concentration of  mgdl or less 
A low serum urate concentration may result from decreased production or increased excretion 
Quantification of urinary uric acid can facilitate a distinction between these two mechanisms 
Patients with hypouricemia secondary to impaired production will have little or no urinary uric acid 
Hypouricemia can be found in about  of hospitalized patients 
In most cases the cause is related to drugs  including salicylates  allopurinol  x ray contrast agents  and glyceryl guaiacholate 
Forced diuresis  used mainly in the treatment of suicide attempt patients and renal colic  may result in hypouricemia 
Total parenteral nutrition can cause profound hypouricemia in some patients 
Several malignant diseases have been associated with hypouricemia  including Hodgkin's disease  sarcoma  glioblastoma  and a variety of carcinomas 
In multiple myeloma  light chains most likely cause tubular epithelial damage and Fanconi syndrome 
Other malignancies have also been associated with tubular dysfunction and increased renal clearance of urate 
The inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone that accompanies some malignancies may lower serum uric acid 
Decreased xanthine oxidase activity  acquired after the development of a malignancy  appears to be an uncommon mechanism 
Hypouricemia produces no symptoms or known morbidity 
Its fortuitous discovery on automated chemistry screening requires no therapy but should alert the physician to search for an underlying cause
