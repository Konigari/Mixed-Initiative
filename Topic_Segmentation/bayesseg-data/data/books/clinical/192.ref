Urea and creatinine are nitrogenous end products of metabolism 
Urea is the primary metabolite derived from dietary protein and tissue protein turnover 
Creatinine is the product of muscle creatine catabolism 
Both are relatively small molecules  and  daltons  respectively that distribute throughout total body water 
In Europe  the whole urea molecule is assayed  whereas in the United States only the nitrogen component of urea the blood or serum urea nitrogen  i e   BUN or SUN is measured 
The BUN  then  is roughly one half  or 
of the blood urea 
The normal range of urea nitrogen in blood or serum is  to  mgdl  or 
to 
mmol urea per liter 
The range is wide because of normal variations due to protein intake  endogenous protein catabolism  state of hydration  hepatic urea synthesis  and renal urea excretion 
A BUN of  mgdl would represent significantly impaired function for a woman in the thirtieth week of gestation 
Her higher glomerular filtration rate GFR  expanded extracellular fluid volume  and anabolism in the developing fetus contribute to her relatively low BUN of  to  mgdl 
In contrast  the rugged rancher who eats in excess of  g protein each day may have a normal BUN of  mgdl 
The normal serum creatinine sCr varies with the subject's body muscle mass and with the technique used to measure it 
For the adult male  the normal range is 
to 
mgdl  or  to  mmolL by the kinetic or enzymatic method  and 
to 
mgdl  or  to  mmolL by the older manual Jaffé reaction 
For the adult female  with her generally lower muscle mass  the normal range is 
to 
mgdl  or  to  mmolL by the enzymatic method

Multiple methods for analysis of BUN and creatinine have evolved over the years 
Most of those in current use are automated and give clinically reliable and reproducible results 
There are two general methods for the measurement of urea nitrogen 
The diacetyl  or Fearon  reaction develops a yellow chromogen with urea  and this is quantified by photometry 
It has been modified for use in autoanalyzers and generally gives relatively accurate results 
It still has limited specificity  however  as illustrated by spurious elevations with sulfonylurea compounds  and by colorimetric interference from hemoglobin when whole blood is used 
In the more specific enzymatic methods  the enzyme urease converts urea to ammonia and carbonic acid 
These products  which are proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample  are assayed in a variety of systems  some of which are automated 
One system checks the decrease in absorbance at  mm when the ammonia reacts with alpha ketoglutaric acid 
The Astra system measures the rate of increase in conductivity of the solution in which urea is hydrolyzed 
Even though the test is now performed mostly on serum  the term BUN is still retained by convention 
The specimen should not be collected in tubes containing sodium fluoride because the fluoride inhibits urease 
Also chloral hydrate and guanethidine have been observed to increase BUN values 
The  Jaffé reaction  in which creatinine is treated with an alkaline picrate solution to yield a red complex  is still the basis of most commonly used methods for measuring creatinine 
This reaction is nonspecific and subject to interference from many noncreatinine chromogens  including acetone  acetoacetate  pyruvate  ascorbic acid  glucose  cephalosporins  barbiturates  and protein 
It is also sensitive to pH and temperature changes 
One or another of the many modifications designed to nullify these sources of error is used in most clinical laboratories today 
For example  the recent kinetic rate modification  which isolates the brief time interval during which only true creatinine contributes to total color formation  is the basis of the Astra modular system 
More specific  non Jaffé assays have also been developed 
One of these  an automated dry slide enzymatic method  measures ammonia generated when creatinine is hydrolyzed by creatinine iminohydrolase 
Its simplicity  precision  and speed highly recommend it for routine use in the clinical laboratory 
Only  fluorocytosine interferes significantly with the test 
Creatinine must be determined in plasma or serum and not whole blood because erythrocytes contain considerable amounts of noncreatinine chromogens 
To minimize the conversion of creatine to creatinine  specimens must be as fresh as possible and maintained at pH  during storage

More than  of urea synthesis occurs in the liver 
Its primary source is dietary protein 
In the gut  the protein is converted into peptides and amino acids  more than  of which are absorbed and carried to the liver 
In the hepatocyte  the amino acids are deaminated and transaminated 
The resulting excess nitrogen feeds into the urea cycle to be incorporated into urea 
The protein moieties escaping absorption by the small bowel  plus recycled urea  are converted into ammonia by gut flora predominantly in the colon 
The ammonia diffuses through the portal circulation into the liver to enter the urea cycle Figure 
The amount of urea produced varies with substrate delivery to the liver and the adequacy of liver function 
It is increased by a high protein diet  by gastrointestinal bleeding based on plasma protein level of 
gdl and a hemoglobin of  gdl   ml of whole blood is equivalent to  g protein  by catabolic processes such as fever or infection  and by antianabolic drugs such as tetracyclines except doxycycline or glucocorticoids 
It is decreased by low protein diet  malnutrition or starvation  and by impaired metabolic activity in the liver due to parenchymal liver disease or  rarely  to congenital deficiency of urea cycle enzymes 
The normal subject on a  g protein diet produces about  g of urea each day 
This newly synthesized urea distributes throughout total body water 
Some of it is recycled through the enterohepatic circulation 
Usually  a small amount less than 
gday is lost through the gastrointestinal tract  lungs  and skin  during exercise  a substantial fraction may be excreted in sweat 
The bulk of the urea  about  gm each day  is excreted by the kidney in a process that begins with glomerular filtration 
At high urine flow rates greater than  mlmin   of the filtered load is reabsorbed  and at flow rates lower than  mlmin  reabsorption may increase to 
Low flow  as in urinary tract obstruction  allows more time for reabsorption and is often associated with increases in antidiuretic hormone ADH  which increases the permeability of the terminal collecting tubule to urea 
During ADH induced antidiuresis  urea secretion contributes to the intratubular concentration of urea 
The subsequent buildup of urea in the inner medulla is critical to the process of urinary concentration 
Reabsorption is also increased by volume contraction  reduced renal plasma flow as in congestive heart failure  and decreased glomerular filtration 
Creatinine formation begins with the transamidination from arginine to glycine to form glycocyamine or guanidoacetic acid GAA 
This reaction occurs primarily in the kidneys  but also in the mucosa of the small intestine and the pancreas 
The GAA is transported to the liver where it is methylated by S adenosyl methionine SAM to form creatine 
Creatine enters the circulation  and  of it is taken up and stored by muscle tissue 
In a reaction catalyzed by creatine phosphokinase CPK  most of this muscle creatine is phosphorylated to creatine phosphate 
Each day  about  of these stores is converted nonenzymatically and irreversibly to creatinine Figure 
Thus  creatinine production essentially reflects lean body mass 
Because this mass changes little from day to day  the production rate is fairly constant 
Absolute creatinine production declines with age in line with decreasing muscle mass 
Unlike urea  creatinine is largely unaffected by gastrointestinal bleeding or by catabolic factors such as fever and steroids 
However  the ingestion of cooked meat can raise the sCr because cooking converts the creatine in meat to creatinine 
Certain drugs  notably the psychoactive phenacemide  can increase the production rate 
Like urea  creatinine distributes throughout total body water 
Its concentration in serum is a function of the usually constant production and excretion rates 
It may be slightly higher in the evening than in the morning  due most likely to dietary meat intake by day 
In normal subjects  creatinine is excreted primarily by the kidneys 
There is minimal extrarenal disposal or demonstrable metabolism 
As a small molecule molecular weight of  daltons  it is freely filtered by the glomerulus 
Unlike urea  it is not reabsorbed or affected by urine flow rate 
It is normally secreted by the tubules in a small but significant amount up to  of total excretion 
Excretion of both urea and creatinine is increased during exercise without producing significant change in serum concentration 
The total creatinine excretion in a normal man averages  to  mgkgday  and in a normal woman  to  mgkgday 
Excretion declines with age  and is about  mgkgday in a  year old man 
However  it should not vary more than  to  in a given individual 
The amount excreted has been used as a rough index of the completeness of daily urine collection 
Measurement of urine creatinine excretion is used in calculating the creatinine clearance cCr 
Short of the more precise but technically impractical inulin clearance  the cCr is the standard clinical tool for estimating GFR  especially in the early stages of renal disease 
In that setting sCr and BUN are not very useful indices of GFR due to their parabolic relationship and to the wide range of normal Figure 
In contrast  the cCr has the major disadvantage of inaccuracies in urine collection  especially during short term clearances or in patients with low urine volumes 
For this reason   hour clearances are preferred for general use  because the usually larger volumes will minimize errors of collection 
The concentration of creatinine in the serum and urine is determined  and with careful attention to the units of measurement  the cCr is calculated as follows 
where uCr = urine creatinine concentration in mgdl  V = urine volume in mlmin  and sCr = serum creatinine concentration in mgdl 
The result may then be standardized to 
m body surface area BSA 
The subject's BSA is related to weight and height and is usually obtained from a nomogram 
Example 
Several shortcuts to estimate the cCr without collecting urine have been proposed 
The earliest and probably the least accurate ignores the subject's age and weight  and simply divides  by the sCr 
The Cockcroft Gault formula is the one usually recommended for use in calculating dosage of drugs especially nephrotoxic antibiotics 
It takes into account the well documented fall in GRF with age as follows 
In advanced renal failure  net creatinine excretion decreases significantly 
Even though tubular secretion increases as GFR falls  it does not compensate for the decrease in filtration when the GFR is below  mlmin 
m 
Further  there is measurable creatinine metabolism by gut flora and  in some patients  decreased creatinine synthesis 
Thus cCr is unreliable and often overestimates GFR in chronic renal failure and in cirrhosis 
It has been suggested that  when the GFR is below  mlmin  the mean of cCr plus urea clearance gives a more accurate index of GFR 
Thus 
Certain drugs may affect cCr without changing GFR 
Salicylates  cimetidine  and trimethoprim interfere with tubular secretion of creatinine and cause a spuriously low cCr 
==========
The BUN and sCr are screening tests of renal function 
Because they are handled primarily by glomerular filtration with little or no renal regulation or adaptation in the course of declining renal function  they essentially reflect GFR 
Unfortunately  their relation to GRF is not a straight line but rather a parabolic curve Figure 
Their values remain within the normal range until more than  of renal function is lost 
Within that range  however  a doubling of the values e g   BUN rising from  to  mgdl or sCr from 
to 
mgdl may mean a  fall in the GFR 
Therefore  in the early stages of renal disease  these tests could create a false sense of security 
Random values above the midrange of normal should be corroborated by a normal cCr before one can confidently tell a patient that his or her kidney function is normal 
At the other end of the curve  small changes in kidney function can produce large increments in BUN and sCr 
Here  these tests are generally adequate to follow a patient's course 
Indeed  the reciprocal of the sCr plotted against time shows a straight line progression of renal disease in each individual patient  and can be used to predict the advent of end stage renal disease 
At all stages of renal insufficiency  the sCr is a much more reliable indicator of renal function than the BUN because the BUN is far more likely to be affected by dietary and physiologic conditions not related to renal function Table 
For example patients with congestive heart failure and intact kidneys commonly present with a BUN of  to  mgdl and an sCr below 
mgdl 
Of course  sCr may rise under some of these extrarenal factors  but seldom will it exceed  to  mgdl 
The stages of renal failure have been defined according to the sCr as follows 
With so many limitations on the usefulness of the BUN  one wonders why the test survives 
When taken with the sCr  it is a very useful clue to the presence of a prerenal or postrenal component to azotemia 
Other factors being normal  a patient with an sCr of 
mgdl would be expected to have a BUN close to  mgdl 
If the BUN is  mgdl instead  then the clinician should begin a search for extrarenal factors Table 
Note that this  to  ratio applies best in moderate to advanced renal failure 
Attention to these reversible complications of uremia can give a patient a reprieve from an untimely sentence of end stage renal disease 
A low BUNCr ratio suggests inadequate protein intake  reduced urea synthesis as in advanced liver disease  supernormal excretion of urea as in sickle cell anemia  increased creatinine production as in rhabdomyolysis  or more effective removal of urea than creatinine during dialysis 
The BUN survives and is finding wide application in the nutritional management of critically ill patients 
The urea nitrogen appearance UNA objectively lets the intensivist know whether the patient's nitrogen needs are being met 
The UNA assessment requires the measurement of BUN at the beginning and end of the period of observation as well as the total urea excretion 
where 
The BUN and creatinine  taken together  are valuable screening tests in evaluating renal disease 
Though they may fall short as absolute indicators of renal function at any given point in time  they are useful in following progression of disease
