Skin  our vital interface with the environment  is the largest organ of the body 
It effectively prevents or neutralizes most physical  chemical  and biologic assaults  extends our senses touch  feel  temperature  pain  and  with eccrine sweating  provides a thermoregulatory control that is unique among animals 
The skin also serves as an immunologic organ  and its role in the regulation of lymphocytes appears to be yet another important  protective function 
The fabric of skin  its epidermis  and supporting dermis contains most of the structural elements found in the deeper body organs 
It should be examined  then  with the expectation that changes in its appearance are signs of external damage or a reflection of hidden  systemic disease 
The various conditions are diagnosed by their primary  or characteristic  lesions  which must be precisely defined in order to be appropriately classified Table 
The nondermatologist should be advised that the peculiar argot of the specialty  which at first seems daunting  represents an additional aid to diagnosis 
Most of the odd sounding Greek and Latin names turn out to be either literal or metaphoric descriptions of the disorders 
There is much learning  and even fun  discovering what pityriasis rosea  lupus erythematosus  comedo  and mycosis fungoides really mean 
A standard medical dictionary  or special dermatologic lexicon  will make the conditions studied more truly memorable! 
==========
Most people  particularly physicians  assume that because they can see  they are good observers 
In truth  observation is a skill that requires conscious effort and practice 
Good natural or artificial light and an appropriately exposed patient are the other prerequisites of a good dermatologic examination 
The technique of observing quadrants of the body using gown and drape sheet will preserve the patient's modesty and ensure cooperation 
Always perform a complete examination rather than look at only what the patient may think is important or suitable for inspection  otherwise the primary lesion  or a more important lesion of which the patient is unaware  may be missed 
Lives have been saved because an examiner found an early resectable melanoma in the middle of the back in a patient who came in with a complaint of poison ivy on the exposed hands and forearms 
Examine each patient from head to toe!

An orderly categorization of skin lesions Table 
proceeds by asking what  how  and where the abnormalities are visualized 
The characteristic morphology of the eruptive lesion size  shape  color  structure  before it is scratched or infected  is important information that immediately limits the diagnostic possibilities 
The arrangement of the individual lesions to each other and the body  and the distribution on particular anatomic sites  are all used as adjunctive data  refining the choices within the morphologic group 
This requires both a very minute inspection of the skin and a more distant global assessment 
The detailed view will show whether special skin structures are involved in the disease process 
Monomorphic lesions of similar size and shape outbreaks characterize disorders that may be limited to hair follicles  for example  or eccrine sweat ducts 
Inflammatory changes of these appendageal structures are common folliculitis and prickly heat  respectively and are quickly removed from further diagnostic consideration 
An attempt should be made to assess the extent  level  and location of the disease within the skin  both by sight and palpation 
This is an integral part of determining the basic morphology and provides insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder 
The early lesion  for example  of erythema nodosum  which originates deep within the dermis  will at ten paces look like any other regular round  red circle 
It must be differentiated from tinea carporis  granuloma annulare  and necrobiosis lipoidica  which may also appear on an affected leg  but with significant and obvious variations in feel and appearance that permit precise identification 
These are the red  dry  scaly lesions that may be nonpalpable macular or slightly infiltrated and papular 
Most people  at one time or another  will manifest one or several signs of this common condition 
On glabrous skin it occurs as flat  superficial  red scaly patches with an indistinct  roughly annular outline 
Typically the scalp  central portions of the face eyebrows  nasolabial crease  retroauricular space  external ears and canals  sternum  and intertriginous areas may be affected 
This chronic  recurring problem is pruritic and prone to secondary bacterial or candidal infection 
No age group is exempt  with the infants cradle cap and diaper rash being one of the first encounters with the condition 
The etiology is unknown  but exacerbations follow periods of stress 
The butterfly rash of systemic lupus erythematosus should not be confused with seborrheic dermatitis 
The collagen disease extends from cheek to cheek across the nose  and may be accompanied by a photosensitivity like dermatitis on exposed areas of the body  along with telangiectatic and atrophic lesions 
In contrast to seborrheic dermatitis  the individual lesions are deeper  palpable  sharply marginated  red papules or plaques  surmounted with a heavy white micaceous scale 
Typical plaques are distributed on the scalp  elbows  knees  and gluteal cleft 
Lesions may assume geometric or unnatural outlines from antecedent trauma e g   linear psoriasis in a scratch mark or plaques limited to the sunburned portion of extremities 
This isomorphic response  or Koebner's phenomenon  is of diagnostic significance  although not specific  and emphasizes the need for preventive measures and patient education in this disease 
The fingernails and toe nails may be involved with minor or gross deformities  and a rheumatoid arthritis like picture occurs in genetically predisposed patients 
The most feared complication of psoriasis and the other papulosquamous diseases is uncontrolled spread of the condition with total body involvement 
The disability is akin to a life threatening thermal injury 
Fungus infections are typically red  round scaly lesions of the nonhairy skin  which have an active spreading border sometimes vesicular and clearing of the central  older portions of the lesions 
The more serpiginous bordered  the more the superficial resemblance to the tracks produced by larval form of the true worm tinea known as creeping eruption 
The fungal hyphae live within the outer dead  horny layers of the skin and may be demonstrated by direct microscopic examination following potassium hydroxide digestion of scrapings Chapter 
The lesions are usually symptomatic  in contrast to those of erythema chronicum migrans see below  which have a somewhat similar clinical appearance 
A variety of clinical forms occur as the neoplastic T cells establish themselves within the skin and systemic organs 
Earliest lesions are macular  erythematous  indistinct scaly superficial areas that ultimately show admixed hues of red and yellowish discolorations poikiloderma 
Larger dermal infiltrations of the abnormal cells produce well circumscribed  deep  red plaques that resemble psoriasis  except that they lack the heavy scale and characteristic distribution of the benign condition 
Instead of the more regularly annular lesions of psoriasis  mycosis fungoides plaques tend toward figurate  scalloped  extravagant outlines 
Ultimately the lesions may ulcerate or produce nodular tumors 
Total body exfoliative erythroderma is frequently seen in severe cases SÃ©zary syndrome 
The appearance of the disorder varies with the age of the patient and the acuteness or chronicity of the condition 
Initially the lesions are very red  poorly defined  macular areas of skin that quickly become scratched  eroded  weeping  and crusted 
In infants the cheeks and extensor extremities are involved  in older children the sites of predilection include the neck and antecubital and popliteal spaces 
The acute lesions are very prone to secondary bacterial infection and predispose the patients to dissemination of herpes simplex  herpes zoster  and vaccinia 
The severe pruritus accompanying the condition causes much rubbing and scratching  leading to marked dryness  scaling  cracking  and lichenification of the skin 
The very distinctive lesions of this condition are oval  pink  superficial maculopapules with a fine peripheral scale 
They are of millimeter to centimeter size and characteristically line up on the torso with the long axes of their ovals parallel to each other and the body creases 
A single  annular  larger  but otherwise similar lesion  called the herald patch  precedes the general breakout over the torso by several days to several weeks 
The lesions tend to be asymptomatic 
Although proof is lacking  the etiology is presumed to be viral  since pityriasis rosea is seen primarily in young adults  in limited endemic areas  in the spring and fall 
A vague prodrome of malaise and low grade fever  and mild lymphadenopathy  may accompany the rash 
It is difficult to distinguish from secondary syphilis except by serological testing 
Weeks to months following the mucocutaneous primary chancre of syphilis  which may not be apparent to the patient  annular  infiltrative maculopapular lesions develop on the trunk  face  and extremities 
They are usually associated with nonspecific constitutional complaints and adenopathy 
The palms and soles are involved  and there may be accompanying patchy hair loss and tumid lesions in the anogenital area condyloma latum and mucous patches flat  grayish  rounded erosions on the oral and genital mucosal surfaces 
Care must be taken when examining patients suspected of syphilis  since the lesions  particularly the anogenital oozing type  contain viable spirochetes 
Serum obtained by scraping a skin lesion may be used for darkfield demonstration of the spirochete  or serological tests  which are always reactive in this stage of the disease  will confirm the diagnosis 
This uncommon disorder  of unknown etiology  like pityriasis rosea is sometimes confused with secondary syphilis 
The characteristic lesions are infiltrative papules with a distinctive polygonal outline 
The lichen planus papules have a flat top  violaceous color  and lacy superficial scale 
They are usually present on the acral extremities  but may also be seen on the genitalia and in patches or erosions on the oral mucosa 
The cutaneous lesions demonstrate the isomorphic or Koebner's response to trauma 
The scalp may show hair loss  with permanent scarring  and the nails may be thinned  pitted  and dystrophic 
Biopsy confirms the diagnosis of this pruritic  chronic  but usually self limited disease 
Pityriasis versicolor  the European and more appropriate name for this common condition  is manifest as a finely scaled macular eruption of diverse colors 
Early lesions are small  annular  and perifollicular  usually pink to tan in color 
They rapidly coalesce and may cover large areas of the upper torso  neck  and upper extremities 
Ultimately  particularly on dark skin  the lesions show as hypopigmented macules 
This condition results from an overgrowth of a yeast organism generally found in small numbers within the hair follicles of many people 
Heat  humidity  and unknown factors contribute to the production of these asymptomatic lesions 
Diagnosis is confirmed by direct microscopic examination of potassium hydroxide digested scrapings of the scales that show budding yeast organisms meatballs and pseudohyphae spaghetti 
The hypopigmentation stems from a direct cytotoxic effect of a specific metabolite of the organism azelaic acid on the pigment cells 
As a result  the return to a normal skin color may be delayed until long after the infection has actually been eradicated and should not be a reason for continued therapy 
Small or larger blisters  depending on their location within the skin  may be very fragile and temporary  producing immediate superficial erosions or deep  persistent dissecting lesions with or without inflammatory cells pustules 
The most common acute inflammations of the skin result from contact with environmental allergic or toxic agents  either chemical or physical 
These produce intensely symptomatic red areas that may be papulovesicular  blistered  and edematous  depending on the degree of damage or local response 
The hallmark is the circumscribed  patterned nature of the eruption  which reflects the mode of contact with the offending agent 
Chemical and physical burns  photosensitivity  and allergic reaction resemble one another and are distinctly more common on exposed parts of the body 
A careful history will identify the suspect  offending material  or modality  but confirmation unfortunately requires controlled reproduction of the condition by appropriate patch testing Chapter   once the acute condition is controlled 
Whether the primary or recurrent type of common viral infection  this condition characteristically consists of grouped  superficial  umbilicated vesicles on an erythematous base 
The intraepidermal location accounts for the tendency to erosion 
Unroofing the vesicle also provides easy access to material that may be smeared on a glass slide and stained to reveal the diagnostic viral infected epidermal cells see Chapter   Tzanck preparation 
The lesions may occur on any part of the body following inoculation  but the peri oral and genital areas are sites of predilection fever blisters  cold sores 
This recredescence of a prior varicella infection greatly resembles the clinical lesions of herpes simplex except that there is an obvious dermatomal distribution corresponding to the cutaneous nerves associated with the infected posterior ganglia 
A prodromal pain or burning frequently precedes the appearance of the grouped vesicles 
Multi nucleated giant cells  similar to those found with herpes simplex  are seen in Tzanck preparations 
Impetigo is a localized staphylococcal andor streptococcal infection that presents as a superficial blister atop a red macule that quickly evolves to eroded  exudative  honey crusted lesions 
On healing  the annular area remains red and is surrounded by a peripheral scale  with central clearing  and may be confused with one of the papulosquamous dermatoses 
The lesions are more common in young children and generally occur on the extremities or the face 
The staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a severe  generalized blistering and desquamation of the skin that results from a circulating bacterial toxin 
This  too  is primarily a disease of infants and young children 
Toxic shock syndrome  also caused by a circulatory staphylococcal toxin  more frequently occurs in adult women as an acute febrile illness with severe multisystem dysfunction and shock 
A toxic erythema may be localized to the groin area or may be diffuse 
It generally proceeds to desquamation of the skin   to  days after onset of the illness 
This disorder  which occurs in children  also shows either a local or diffuse erythema associated with edematous palms and soles  which desquamate 
It does not manifest the renal insufficiency  hypotension  and shock of the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome 
Kawasaki's disease is still of unknown etiology 
This uncommon disease of adults is one of the few truly life threatening dermatoses 
It is characterized by generalized  flaccid vesicles and bullae  on either normal or reddened skin  which quickly erode and crust 
The mucous membranes are severely involved and responsible for the considerable morbidity attending the untreated condition 
The disease results from an autoimmune reaction directed against the epidermis that produces acantholytic cells devoid of usual attachment processes 
These may be seen readily in Tzanck preparations of the blister  and the diagnosis confirmed by biopsy and immunofluorescent studies demonstrating the specific antibody reaction at the cell surfaces 
The relatively superficial locale of the intraepidermal pathology accounts for the tendency of the pemphigus blister to spread and enlarge when pressed Nikolsky's sign 
This is a rare disease of older adults  which runs a symptomatically disturbing but generally benign course 
The bullae present in this condition are large and tense  and are randomly distributed on the general body  without the regular and severe mucous membrane involvement that characterizes pemphigus 
The blisters are subepidermal and therefore do not enlarge or rupture easily with finger pressure 
Immunofluorescent biopsy technique reveals a diagnostic pattern of antibodies localized at the epidermal basement membrane 
Infestation with the human scabies mite must always be ruled out when a patient complains of severe nocturnal itching and manifests multiple excoriations in and about the axillae  flexor aspects of the wrists  interdigital finger spaces  nipples  waistline  and genitalia 
The pathognomonic burrow  a black dotted line produced by the egg laying female  or the linear small vesicles that contain the mite's eggs and feces  are difficult to locate against the background of multiple scratch marks and erosions 
Definitive diagnosis is established by microscopic demonstration of the organism or its products Chapter 
As the name of the condition implies  a wide variety of lesion forms macules  papules  vesicles  pustules sharing a common inflammatory characteristic  the erythema or redness  are grouped together in this category 
Since erythema multiforme itself represents the central ground of a spectrum of disorders of diverse etiology  all characterized by damage to the skin's vasculature  it is useful to consider the group in its entirety 
At any point in the evolution of these conditions  one  several  or all types of the lesions described may be present 
Diagnosis depends on the sequence of systemic  as well as local  events  and definite recognizable patterns emerge as classic syndromes 
For the most part  additional investigation will be required to pinpoint the etiologic agent  since the reaction patterns may be broadly categorized as allergic reactions 
As a common example  all the viral exanthems fit into this inclusive definition  yet each can be separated from the other by the evolution of the typical rash  the accompanying physical signs  complaints  and epidemiology 
The lesions encountered depend on the type of vessel superficial  small versus  deep  large and the degree of damage 
The most subtle trauma yields the evanescent lesions of urticaria at one extreme  progressing through fixed macular erythemas  vesicles  bullae  petechiae  purpura  and necrotic ulcerations 
The search for the etiology of any of the reactions is as wide and complicated as outlined for urticaria Chapter   the least alarming of the representative lesion types 
Although the broad view of possibilities should be kept in mind  each type of lesion is associated with a smaller range of probabilities  as the following representative samples indicate 
Alternating rings of persistent erythema constitute the typical target or iris lesion that characterizes this condition 
The distinct maculopapular lesions may be quite infiltrated raised and have a peripheral pallor 
They vary in size from millimeter to centimeter diameter and are distributed symmetrically and diffusely over the body 
Palmar and plantar lesions  as well as those on the mucosal surfaces  are common 
The central portion of the bull's eye lesions may vesiculate and form a clear blister  or hemorrhagic lesion  depending on the severity of the condition 
Anything from urticaria through frank purpuric lesions may accompany the pathognomonic iris type 
The severe form  which seriously involves mucous membranes of the mouth  eyes  and genitalia  is termed the Stevens Johnson syndrome 
The more recently described toxic epidermal necrolysis is considered to be a severe  similar variant  usually an adverse reaction to drugs 
Erythema multiforme accompanies a variety of infections and may be seen in predictable course following each episode of recurrent herpes simplex infections cold sores  fever blisters  or genital herpes in susceptible individuals 
Erythema multiforme can occur after streptococcal infections  toxoid or sera injections  and may accompany deep fungal infections  the collagen diseases particularly systemic lupus erythematosus  and occult neoplasms 
For years it was known that tick bites produce a peculiar  slowly expanding superficial annular lesion or lesions that slightly resemble dermatophyte ringworm infections 
There is an active red  infiltrated border with a bluish red  flat center that gives the appearance of clearing 
Unlike fungus infections  the lesions  which often reach prodigious size  are asymptomatic 
Today we know this as the presenting sign of Lyme disease  if untreated  neurologic  rheumatic  and cardiac manifestations may follow in succeeding weeks or even months 
The tick is the vector for the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi  which causes the symptom complex 
The nodules are more difficult to appreciate than the typical contusion like quality of the clinical presentation 
The patient with erythema nodosum appears to have been bashed across the shins with a baseball bat 
The lesions are tender  deep  dusky red  circular areas of induration 
In many respects  the etiologic possibilities parallel those of erythema multiforme 
Streptococcal sore throat  viral  chlamydial  and deep fungal diseases  particularly during endemics  may be accompanied by erythema nodosum 
Drugs  including oral contraceptives  have produced the lesions 
In sarcoidosis  erythema nodosum is a sign of favorable prognosis 
With febrile conditions it may be difficult to distinguish erythema nodosum from deep cellulitis or erysipelas on clinical grounds alone 
Bleeding into the skin petechia  purpura  ecchymosis is not invariably a sign of vascular damage  but may reflect underlying coagulopathies 
Actinic purpura is commonly seen on the extensor forearms of aged white patients as a result of long standing ultraviolet degradation of supporting collagen and subsequent easy bruisability of the unprotected vessels 
The purple ecchymotic lakes only slowly fade  and invariably leave jagged  stellate linear  ivory white scars 
The nonvasculitic  nonallergic purpuras mentioned above can be clinically separated from those associated with the reaction pattern type 
With allergic vascular damage the lesions are deeper  infiltrated  and constitute the palpable purpuras 
These are usually external signs of serious internal diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  systemic lupus erythematosus  and the Henoch SchÃ¶nlein syndrome 
Palpable purpura is also associated with a variety of septicemias which notably include Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever 
In subacute bacterial endocarditis painful infarctive papules on digits constitute Osler's nodes 
These may be accompanied by subungual splinter hemorrhages  and the nonpainful palmar purpuras known as Janeway spots 
Palpable purpura  pustules  and frank infarction of the skin are also seen in the septicemias associated with gonococcal  meningococcal  and pseudomonas infections 
Occlusion of the distal hair follicle above the functioning sebaceous gland leads to distension of the follicle and produces the cardinal lesions  comedones 
Those remaining just below the skin surface closed comedones are flesh colored  enlarging papules  while the impacted follicles that communicate with the exterior open comedones are dark appearing masses commonly called blackheads 
The color is from native melanin pigment  as well as oxidized lipid material  and is not an accumulation of external dirt 
These lesions continue to expand until they break through the distended follicular epithelium  incite a brisk inflammatory response  and quickly pass through to their resolution as erythematous papules and pustules 
Larger cystic dilatations incite larger abscess like reactions  which heal slowly and frequently leave permanent scars 
To some degree  acne is a universal mark of adolescence  and both external friction  rubbing  oils and internal factors endogenous steroids contribute to the evolution of the condition 
The face and the upper torso are areas of predilection 
The distinctive feature of Agent Orange exposure in man is a severe form of comedonal open lesions known as chloracne 
Either systemic or topical exposure to a variety of halogenated biphenyl organics predisposes to this condition  without regard to age of the patient 
Acne like eruptions are associated with elevated adrenal corticoids Cushing's disease or exogenous drugs and from ingestion or administration of iodides and bromides 
These outbreaks may be limited to acne prone skin or become more generalized 
They are usually monomorphic  inflammatory lesions erythematous papules and pustules without the usual comedonal component visible in acne vulgaris 
Both bacterial and nonbacterial folliculitis occurs anytime hair bearing areas are subjected to external friction  heat  humidity  etc 
Occupational exposure to machine oils and tars produces localized varieties that contain all types of lesions seen in acne 
A more generalized eruption  actually a Pseudomonas folliculitis is reported with recreational hot tub immersion 
Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a common affliction in the bearded skin of black men where the irritation of shaving and the physical characteristics of the hair join to produce plugged follicles that trap and deflect the growing hairs 
These appear to burrow and grow into the skin  inciting inflammatory pustules and granulomatous papules 
This is an acne like condition that occurs on the face and upper torso of older patients 
Susceptible individuals are usually very fair skinned 
Both ultraviolet damage and easy facial flushing are prerequisites for the development of the lesions 
The center of the face  including the nose itself  bears the brunt of the damage 
Telangiectases and intensely inflammatory red papules and pustules develop  as well as fleshy granulomatous papules that progress unless the patient receives adequate therapy and counseling 
The bulbous  red  misshapen nose is the ultimate consequence of continued neglect 
Deep dermal cellular infiltrates  the focal  chronic inflammatory granulomas usually present as raised  red to skin colored papulonodular lesions 
They are of diverse origin  and although some may have particular shapes  colors  and distributions  a biopsy is generally required to confirm the diagnosis 
Whenever foreign material is deposited within the dermis  it incites a local cellular inflammatory reaction  which varies with the type of material introduced 
Isolated  red brown nodules and papules on exposed skin may result from splinters  thorns  sand  insects biting parts  or specific materials such as the oxides of beryllium or zirconium  which incite intense histocytic activity and granuloma formation 
Even in scabies  where the characteristic lesion is vesicular  deeper penetration of the mite in infants or in genital lesions in adults produces long lasting  severely pruritic granulomas 
A common tumor  the dermatofibroma or histiocytoma cutis  probably represents a foreign body reaction  usually to a long forgotten insect bite 
The lesions occur on exposed parts of the extremities as isolated 
to 
cm  oval  firm to hard  skin colored nodules 
Since they are bound within the dermis  lateral pressure about the lesion produces the so called dimple sign where the lesion appears to retract below the surface 
The dermal tumor is benign  but after years it may produce a gradual darkening and change in the overlying epidermis  which signals the development of a basal cell carcinoma 
Deep  chronic infections  particularly those caused by mycobacteria  fungi  leishmaniasis  and syphilis  produce slowly growing lesions that range from coalescent papules to large  fungating tumors 
Only biopsy and appropriate staining procedures will distinguish the type and etiology 
Large collections of lymphocytes in proliferative disorders lymphomas  present within the skin  mimic these infectious granulomas 
Pyogenic granuloma is a common tumor that resembles both a granuloma and angioma see below in appearance and behavior 
It is a bright red  isolated  rapidly growing lesion that protrudes atop the skin from a surrounding  slightly elevated cuff of normal tissue 
It usually occurs on exposed parts of the body and may vary in size from 
to 
cm or more 
It is friable  bleeds very easily  and may be rubbed off  only to recur quickly 
It is quite benign  despite its worrisome appearance and behavior  and represents exuberant granulation tissue from trivial unrecognized trauma 
Although a systemic disease  sarcoidosis also manifests its typical granulomas within the skin 
They are more common in blacks in the United States  and present as yellowish brown to violaceous lesions on the face  particularly about the eyes and on the nose and mouth 
Lesions in the scalp present as a scarring alopecia 
The number of specific cutaneous lesions  other than previously mentioned with erythema nodosum  appears to have no prognostic relationship with the systemic disease 
The histiocytic cells that make up these lesions are characteristically laden with lipids and are clinically yellow in color 
Eruptive xanthomas are smaller  papular lesions that arise from a erythematous base and may be confused with inflammatory dermatoses 
They usually appear suddenly  are widespread and symmetrically distributed on the torso  and are the consequence of a systemic abnormality that has resulted in elevated serum triglycerides 
Noneruptive xanthomas slowly coalesce to form larger  yellow tumors usually on the elbows  knees  knuckles  buttocks  and Achilles tendon 
Also due to an underlying lipid disorder  these xanthomas are associated with individuals who will manifest severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Xanthelasma are common flat xanthomas  seen as plaques on the eyelids 
About half the patients with these lesions have associated increased serum cholesterol levels 
Xanthelasma are of more diagnostic significance and concern when seen in younger patients 
This relatively uncommon condition has very distinctive lesions  except that they are  with inadequate examination  mistaken for other common skin disorders 
The typical annular plaque or plaques are composed of dermal papules that are pink to red and surround a central area of flat  normal appearing skin 
At first glance  they are easy to confuse with tinea corporis except that the fungal disease involves the superficial layers of skin  with the spreading  active border of vesicles andor scaling  which is absent in granuloma annulare 
The fungal infection is very pruritic 
Granuloma annulare is usually found on the exposed extremities  particularly in children  and may represent atypical reaction patterns to insect bites 
Histologically  the lesions show necrobiosis of the dermal collagen and a distinctive histocytic and lymphocytic infiltrate  similarities shared with rheumatoid nodules and necrobiosis lipoidica see below 
Multiple  symmetrical  subcutaneous nodules frequently occur with rheumatoid arthritis at areas of pressure around joints 
They resemble the tophi of gout in their juta articular involvement at the elbows  knees  and fingers  and  in bedridden patients  are found over the buttocks  spine  and occiput 
Calcinosis cutis nodules similarly resemble the gouty tophi except that they are harder and may drain their chalky contents through inflammatory ulcerations of the overlying skin 
These calcium deposits of soft tissue accompany dermatomyositis  scleroderma  and systemic diseases associated with hypercalcemia 
These are also growths that appear above or around joints 
The smaller cystic  nodular tumors frequently appear on the dorsum of the hand at a distal interphalangeal joint 
The lesion may be skin colored or erythematous and occasionally is painful 
A larger form  which occurs subcutaneously over the wrist  is termed a ganglion 
These tumors are frequently attached to the underlying joint capsules and are benign but difficult to treat 
Morphologically different growths  ranging from macular  stable discolorations e g   angiomas to large  rapidly expanding tumors e g   malignant melanoma are included in this category to stress the neoplastic nature of the conditions 
Most will be readily recognized by an examiner as abnormal growths  and it is usual to establish the precise diagnosis by biopsy 
The common wart is an epidermal tumor initiated by the human papova virus 
The appearance of warts varies according to the part of the body infected and the particular strain of the virus 
Most common are the raised  papulonodular  rough  irregular scaly growths seen on the extremities of children 
The lesions may be isolated or  by confluence  form large plaque like islands of tumor 
On non pressure bearing areas they are exophytic and protrude above the skin  on the palmar and plantar surfaces  they are pushed down into the surrounding tissue 
Flat warts are a variety seen on glabrous skin  particularly on the face 
Because of their soft  red to tan  nonscaly  smooth  maculopapular appearance  they are easily confused with inflammatory dermatoses  particularly lichen planus 
When warts are distributed in a linear fashion from scratching and innoculation  this also effectively mimics Koebner's phenomenon isomorphic response 
Genital warts condyloma accuminatum  venereal warts are rapidly growing  soft  pedunculated  or sessile tumors that have fine finger like fronds or projections 
In moist intertriginous areas they may become whitish  and must be differentiated from condyloma latum  the genital lesion of secondary syphilis 
Unlike warts  the luetic lesions are very broad  flat  tumid excrescences 
Flat  wart like lesions on the genitals should be biopsied since some are intraepidermal carcinomas  a condition called Bowenoid papulosis see Bowen's disease below 
There is  indeed  mounting evidence to suggest that genital wart infections  as well as those of herpes simplex  predispose to genital carcinoma 
These are monomorphic  very characteristic tumors caused by a human pox virus 
The individual lesions are  to  mm pearly  flesh colored papulonodules that have an umbilicated center 
They are usually discrete  single lesions that arise from nonerythematous  normal appearing skin 
There may be few  or they may be widespread and easily confused with inflammatory dermatoses 
Genital lesions are associated with venereal spread of this  as the name suggests  contagious infection 
The very common moles are benign tumors of pigment cells that can appear anywhere on the body 
During the first decade they tend to be flat  macular  oval to round  brownish small tumors  to  mm  which ultimately become more elevated after puberty 
Pregnancy and exogenous progestogens may darken the tumors or increase their size 
In later years the lesions become lighter in color  pedunculated or sessile resembling skin tags  and may disappear spontaneously 
Large congenital nevi  particularly the bathing suit nevi that cover extensive areas of skin  are considered to be premalignant tumors 
Additionally  there appear to be less obvious acquired nevi associated with a familial tendency toward malignant melanoma 
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome  individuals will develop after puberty numerous dark lesions on the torso  which careful examination shows to be clinically atypical nevi 
They are larger more than  to  mm  have an irregular rather than oval to round shape  with notched or rough and indistinct borders 
The pigmentation also varies  showing different shades of black and brown within the individual lesion  as well as admixtures of white and red 
These soft  pedunculated  pin head to pea sized  fleshy out growths are very common with increasing age  more so in heavy patients 
They occur in intertriginous areas  most notably the axillae  neck  and groin  and are benign but bothersome 
They are seen in profusion as part of the clinical presentation of acanthosis nigricans  since both conditions are essentially papillomatous proliferations of skin 
In acanthosis nigricans  the dark discoloration is very striking again  in the neck  axillae  groin but the velvety appearance and feel signify the proliferative quality of the condition 
Late onset acanthosis nigricans in adults is associated with adenocarcinomas  particularly of the gastrointestinal tract 
It is also found in young obese patients  with certain drugs oral contraceptives  corticosteroids  high doses of nicotinic acid  and accompanies a variety of endocrinopathies diabetes mellitus  notably 
These very common tumors occur generally after the fourth and fifth decades  continue to proliferate slowly  and run in families 
The lesions have a stuck on appearance  since they are essentially superficial overgrowths of normal epidermal cells 
They range in size from a few millimeters to centimeters  and vary in color from light tan to black  from barely perceptible thickness to protuberent excresences  and have an irregular  verrucous  soft  friable scaly covering 
They occur primarily in the nonexposed torso  but may also be present on the face and extremities 
In dark skinned people  the lesions on the face and neck present as small  pedunculated black spheroids of several millimeters in diameter 
This peculiar variety has been called dermatosis papulosa nigra  a rather near summation of their appearance in Latin 
Aside from their cosmetic concern to patients  the tumors provoke a great deal of anxiety because they fulfill the broad warning signs of skin cancer 
They are expanding  dark tumors that bleed when traumatized and quickly regrow when scraped off accidently 
A rare form of eruptive seborrheic keratosis  similar to the usual type except for its explosive and widespread onset  is associated with malignancies  particularly gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas 
This constitutes the so called Sign of Leser TrÃ©lat  an external marker of occult internal neoplasms 
These are common congenital  benign neoplasms of blood vessels that vary greatly in appearance and significance  depending on the type  degree  and location of the vascular abnormality 
The nevus flammeus  which is an overgrowth and dilation of superficial capillaries  produces a flat  pink to violet  mostly macular discoloration of the skin 
It is present at the nuchal scalp of many infants at birth and may persist throughout life 
When similar lesions occur in zonal distribution on the face  these so called port wine stains are at least cosmetically disturbing 
In the Slurge Weber syndrome  the angioma occurs within the skin innervated by the trigeminal nerve and is associated with an angiomatosis of the cerebral meninges and choroid of the eye  with visual disturbances and hemiplegia 
In the Klippel TrÃ©naunay Weber syndrome there is an extensive unilateral nevus flammeus  with or without deeper angiomas  or lymphangiomas  which is associated with underlying bone and soft tissue hypertrophy 
Arteriovenous fistulas occur and may produce functional hemodynamic changes as well 
Strawberry hemangiomas involve growth of larger  deeper vessels  they are visible at or shortly after birth as well defined protruberant  fiery  red to purple  very obvious growths 
They vary in size from the insignificant to exuberant  some with accelerated growth for a period of weeks or months 
They usually involute spontaneously during early childhood 
Cavernous hemangiomas  which arise from even larger and deeper venous structures within the skin  are cystic  ill defined growths with a decidedly blue color 
Although they occur as isolated tumors  a number of associated conditions have been recognized 
Kassabach Merritt syndrome occurs in infants with large hemangiomas and may be fatal in up to  of the patients due to an associated bleeding tendency 
There is a profound thrombocytopenia secondary to the tumor related coagulopathy 
Von Hippel Lindau syndrome consists of cavernous hemangiomas associated with underlying similar lesions of the central nervous system 
Maffucci's syndrome is characterized by cutaneous cavernous hemangiomas with enchondromas 
Nodular and angiomatous lesions occur early in life with the dyschondroplastic changes and skeletal deformities 
Encroachment of the brain from skull lesions and malignant degeneration of both the angiomas and enchondromas are serious complications of this rare disorder 
Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a very descriptive name for this uncommon  autosomal inheritable condition 
The lesions are small  cavernous hemangiomas of the skin that appear as soft  easily collapsed  blue  cystic coalescent lesions 
They are associated with gastrointestinal angiomas  usually of the small intestine  which may bleed and produce clinical problems 
Cherry angiomas occur on the torso with advancing age in adults  appearing as discrete  multiple  widespread   to  mm  bright red  slightly elevated tumors that blanch easily with pressure 
They are the most common vascular tumor found on the skin and have no clinical significance 
Spider angiomas are flat macular or elevated lesions composed of a central dilated arteriole surrounded by a radial burst of superficial legs  or radicles  which collapse and disappear when pressure is applied to the feeder vessel 
They vary in size from millimeters to centimeters and are usually found on the face  upper torso  or extremities 
Their occurrence in pregnancy and with a variety of hepatic disorders suggests a common endocrine origin such as increased estrogen stimulation 
Vascular spiders are also classified as telangiectases  which are dilated vessels  rather than the result of proliferative activity 
Telangiectases tend to be uniformly flat macular  vascular mats and are a prominent feature of several of the so called collagen diseases  including systemic lupus erythematosis  dermatomyositis  and systemic sclerosis 
Here they tend to be found on the face and the distal extremities 
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Rendu Osler Weber disease  the mucosa of the nose  lips  tongue  and mouth are almost always involved and may constitute an important clinical clue to the etiology of obscure internal bleeding in almost any organ system 
Angiokeratomas are angiomas with a covering scale and are commonly found in the scrotal and vulvar skin of older people 
They have no clinical significance 
Should similar lesions be seen in young men with spread to the lower trunk and proximal lower extremities  they may be the presenting sign of Fabry's disease angiokeratoma corporis diffusum 
This is a sex linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism that produces widespread  multisystem disease  with grave renal and cardiovascular consequences 
Kaposi's sarcoma  though not truly a benign tumor  is of vascular origin and has an apparently prolonged course as a malignancy  with multifocal systemic development rather than metastatic spread 
Unlike those associated with patients afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS  it was usually found uncommonly in elderly men of Jewish or Italian heritage  where it produces more cutaneous  rather than systemic  problems 
The usual presentation is as purple plaques  nodules  and tumors of the lower legs and dorsa of the feet 
In AIDS patients the lesions tend to be more widespread and atypical  although histologically congruent with the classic variety 
These are smooth surfaced  yellowish  freely movable intradermal tumors with a soft  cystic feel  which on close examination show a central pore 
They vary from millimeter to several centimeters in size  and if squeezed  either express through the pore or rupture  liberating a noisome cheesy substance 
They are erroneously called sebaceous cysts  but take their origin from the follicular epithelium 
They tend to become apparent after puberty and at midlife 
Those occurring in children should raise the suspicion that they are the cutaneous marker for Gardner's syndrome and are associated with a familial tendency to malignant colonic polyps 
Small papular tumors at first  basal cell carcinomas progressively grow and develop a pearly infiltrative border with dilated vessels at the rim and surrounding skin 
Larger lesions may show central ulcerations and crusting 
Although the tumors are typically flesh colored  pigmented basal cell carcinomas may be mistaken for melanomas 
These cancers typically appear on sun exposed areas of fair skinned people 
This also is found on exposed skin and is usually a more rapid growing ulcerative tumor than basal cell carcinoma 
Histopathological examination is frequently required to differentiate between these carcinomas 
They are both regularly found on sun ravaged skin that shows mottled pigmentary changes  yellowish  elastotic dermal deposits  atrophy  and telangiectases 
Actinic keratoses are poorly defined  pink to red  superficial scaly lesions  which are precursors to the carcinomas 
They have a rough  dry feel that usually alerts the patients to their presence 
The term senile keratoses previously used for these lesions should be urgently abandoned  both for the confusion it creates with seborrheic keratoses  which tend to occur on older people and because actinic keratoses and frank basal and squamous cell carcinomas also occur on the sun exposed skin of susceptible young people 
This more often resembles an isolated plaque of psoriasis occurring as a solitary crusty  well marginated plaque  often on sun exposed areas 
This is a more exudative  weepy  red  superficial  well defined plaque  usually occurring on the nipple or areola of the breast or on the anogenital skin 
It is associated with an underlying intraductal carcinoma 
The clinical characteristics and behavior of melanomas vary from the slow growing  flat  brownish  irregular spots on sun exposed skin usually the face of elderly people lentigo maligna  Hutchinson's freckle  malignant melanoma in situ through the very aggressive dark  nodular  erosive tumors that may arise anywhere 
There is also a marked variation of abnormal colorsblue  red  and whiteand irregularity of shape  with the deeper tumors having a much poorer prognosis 
Generalized darkening of the skin is difficult to appreciate because changes may be gradual and require familiarity with the normal coloration of the patient 
Diffuse hyper pigmentation of the skin  however  notably occurs in Addison's disease  acromegaly  hemochromatosis  and in the rare inborn errors of metabolism of ochronosis and the tissue storage lipoidoses 
Exogenous drugs and poisons are also occasionally associated with generalized pigmentary changes  including certain tetracyclines  phenothiazine  antimalarials  and heavy metals 
Local areas of hyperpigmentation that have systemic implications include the following 
Small brown to black macules  usually under  mm in diameter  are observed on the face and extremities during the second and third decade of life 
They are asymptomatic and have a predilection for the vermillion lips  buccal and rectal mucosa  central portion of the face  and tips of the fingers and toes 
This is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition associated with gastrointestinal polyps that are  for the most part  benign 
This autosomal dominantly inherited condition is characterized by multiple generalized small dark freckles lentigines present at birth and the other parts of its mnemomic title lentignosis  electrocardiographic conduction defects  ocular hyperteloresis  pulmonary stenosis  abnormalities of the gentilia  retardation of growth  and deafness  sensor neural 
Regularly outlined coast of California brown macules  to  cm or more  usually more than six in number  and axillary freckling Crowe's sign are the characteristic local areas of hyperpigmentation that characterize this condition 
They have their onset during infancy and increase in size and number 
The conspicuous cutaneous neurofibromas develop after puberty 
In  of the cases  the condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant  and there may be a wide range of associated systemic conditions 
Lisch nodules are pigmented iris hamartomas that are asymptomatic but are useful in establishing the diagnosis 
A variety of osseous abnormalities  primarily scoliosis  are seen 
Symptomatic tumors of the acoustic and optic nerves  and mental retardation  are frequent central nervous system problems 
Acromegaly  cretinism  thyroid abnormalities  Addison's disease  and diabetes have all been reported with neurofibromatosis  and a significant number of patients with pheochromocytoma also have multiple neurofibromatoses 
Hypertension and severe vascular deformities are also reported in children with the condition 
Large tumors may produce grotesque malformations of the physiognomy  as exemplified by the notorious Elephant Man 
Hypopigmentation or depigmentation may occur locally following any inflammatory condition of the skin and is most common in tinea versicolor infections 
Vitiligo probably represents a systemic autoimmune response against the patient's own pigment cells 
It occurs as sharply marginated  usually annular  areas of white skin 
The lesions are symmetrical and have a predilection for the face  neck  and acral parts of the extremities 
Other autoimmune diseases thyroiditis  pernicious anemia  diabetes mellitus  and alopecia areata may be associated with the condition 
Peculiar  geometric  elliptical shaped  hypopigmented macules ash leaf macules scattered on the torso are considered one of the earliest pathognomic signs of tuberous sclerosis 
This autosomal  dominantly inherited syndrome is also known as epiloia epilepsy  low intelligence  and adenoma sebaceum 
The skin lesions adenoma sebaceum are multiple  yellow pink papulonodules that develop in the central portion of the face during childhood and superficially resemble a persistent acne 
Periungual fibromas and shagreen patches leathery  collagenous plaques about the lumbosacral area are also commonly seen 
Retinal and cerebral tumors account for the neurologic findings associated with the condition  and there is an increased incidence of other unusual tumors renal hamartomas and cardiac rhabdomyomas in these patients 
The hallmark of the disease is the poorly defined induration and thickening of skin  primarily in the acral extremities and the face 
The patient develops a characteristic pinched appearance and is unable to smile easily 
Irregular mottling and pigmentary disturbances are seen in the affected skin 
Hypopigmentation  with surrounding color about the hair follicles  produces a salt and pepper look 
Ulcerations  particularly of the fingertips  may be present  and as previously described  telangiectasia and calcinosis cutis 
This resembles scleroderma  manifesting a marked edema and induration of the extremities 
Most patients have eosinophilia and hypergammaglolubinemia  and on deep biopsy  a histopathologic picture distinct from scleroderma 
An uncommon diffuse  slightly erythematous induration of skin usually on the upper torso and neck 
If the face is involved  the resemblance is of the moon face and buffalo hump appearance of Cushing's disease 
The condition may follow acute bacterial febrile conditions  although an association with diabetes mellitus is noted 
Acute bacterial infection presents as red  hot  sharply marginated  indurated  tender plaques  most commonly seen on the face and extremities 
Streptococcal infection is a frequent cause  although hemophilus infection may be seen in children 
Infections by unusual organisms e g   cryptococcus may occur in immunosuppressed patients 
Repeated Streptococcal infections of the extremities  with resultant hypertrophy  ultimately lead to elephantiasis  a grotesque enlargement of the affected part with fibrous overgrowth of the skin and the development of deep nodular tumors with intervening crypts and tunnels 
A doorway diagnosis of the typical lesion can be made  so characteristic is its appearance 
A well circumscribed  annular to oval  atrophic plaque on the anterior shins  usually several centimeters in diameter  NLD has a typical yellowish color with a mottled erythema contributed by the superficial  dilated blood vessels 
A biopsy is diagnostic 
Although less than 
diabetics have NLD  more than  of patients with NLD have diabetes 
Long standing lesions frequently ulcerate 
The typical lesions are bone white  very smooth  atrophic  sharply marginated  oval to annular plaques that typically appear on the genitalia  although they may appear anywhere on the body 
Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy 
The chronic lesions may ulcerate and develop areas of squamous cell carcinoma 
The ulcerations that accompany arteriosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease are painful  sharply marginated  and found on the lateral lower extremities and toes 
The lesions associated with venous insufficiency are more commonly present over the medial malleolus  usually with pitting edema  varicosities  mottled pigmentation  erythema  and nonpalpable petechiae and purpura 
The stasis dermatitis and ulcers are generally pruritic rather than painful 
These also occur on the lower extremities and are painful  sharply marginated lesions  which may have associated palpable purpuras and hemorrhagic bullae 
The collagen diseases  septicemias  and a variety of hematological disorders e g   thrombocytopenia  dysproteinemia may be the cause of this severe  acute condition 
This occurs as single or multiple  very tender ulcers of the lower legs 
A deep red to purple  undermined border surrounds the purulent central defect 
Biopsy fails to reveal a vasculitis 
In half the patients it is associated with a systemic disease such as ulcerative colitis  regional ileitis  or leukemia 
These ulcers follow direct innoculation with a variety of organisms and may be associated with significant regional adenopathy 
Mycobacteria infection  anthrax  diphtheria  blastomyosis  sporotrichosis  tularemia  and cat scratch fever are examples 
The genital ulcers of primary syphilis are typically nontender with a clean  firm base 
Those of chancroid and granuloma inguinale tend to be ragged  dirty  and more extravagant lesions
