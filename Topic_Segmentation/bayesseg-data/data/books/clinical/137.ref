Body size and habitus describe the physical characteristics of an individual and include such considerations as physique  general bearing  and body build 
Historically  attempts have been made to classify humans into discrete somatotypes mesomorphicmuscular and athletic  endomorphicrounded and stout  and ectomorphictall and thin  and to relate habitus to propensity to disease e g   habitus apoplectus 
These terms have little clinical relevance today  and body size and habitus can be said to encompass the more quantifiable measurements of height  weight  body proportions  skinfold thickness  and mid upper arm circumference 
These measurements do not have true normal or abnormal values  but must be interpreted in the context of an individual's age  sex  clinical status  and previous measurements 
The values can be plotted as a percentile of a reference population or as a percentage of an ideal value 
Height is the length from the plantar surface of the foot to the crown of the head 
Heights that fall below the rd percentile or above the th percentile may require investigation 
Weight is the total weight of the body 
Weights greater than  of ideal suggest obesity  while weights less than  of ideal may indicate severe malnutrition 
Body proportions include the trunk to limb ratio and the arm span 
The trunk  or upper segment  is represented by the distance from the symphysis pubis to the crown of the head 
The lower segment is the distance from the symphysis pubis to the plantar surface of the foot and represents the limb contribution to total height 
At birth the normal upper to lower segment ratio is 
The legs grow more rapidly than the trunk  and by age  the segments are equal and remain so in adults 
The arm span is the distance between the tips of the middle fingers with the arms fully extended 
In adults the arm span should equal the height 
Mid upper arm measurements are taken at the midpoint between the acromial process and the olecranon process 
Skinfold thickness at this site is a measure of subcutaneous fat and is used to estimate total adiposity 
Obesity is indicated by a value greater than  mm in men and  mm in women 
Severe depletion of energy stores is indicated by values below the th percentile 
Mid upper arm circumference is used to calculate midupper arm muscle circumference 
Muscle circumferences less than the th percentile suggest severe depletion of protein stores 
==========
Accurate measurement of height requires a firm horizontal surface  a measuring tape attached to a true vertical surface  and a movable block at right angles to the vertical surface that can be brought down to make contact with the scalp 
The unsteady base and flexible bar of most office scales limit their accuracy 
The subject should stand in bare feet  with the heels together and the back as straight as possible 
The outer canthus of the eye should be in the same horizontal plane as the external auditory meatus when the headpiece is brought down to the crown of the head 
Body weight should be measured on beam scales with nondetachable weights 
Spring scales are not sufficiently accurate 
The scale should be calibrated to zero 
The patient should be dressed in light clothing without shoes 
Non ambulatory patients can be weighed in bed or wheelchair scales 
Patients estimates of their weights and heights are not reliable 
Arm span is most easily determined by doubling the distance between the sternal notch and the tip of the middle finger of an extended arm 
The lower segment measurement is taken with the subject standing and is the distance from the symphysis pubis to the floor 
The upper segment is calculated by subtracting the lower segment from the total height 
Triceps skinfold thickness is generally measured at the midpoint  between the acromial process of the scapula and the olecranon process of the ulna of the left arm  using a skinfold caliper 
This point is marked on the posterior side with the patient sitting or standing with the arm hanging loosely at the side 
Patients unable to sit may be measured supine in bed with the arm folded across the chest 
The skin and subcutaneous tissues should be pinched between the thumb and forefinger  cm above the mark and gently pulled away from the underlying muscle 
While the grasp is maintained  the calipers are placed over the skinfold at the midpoint mark  left in place for  seconds and the value is read 
The average of three separate readings is recorded in millimeters 
Plastic calipers may not be accurate 
The subscapular skinfold is similarly measured  cm below the right scapula 
Arm circumference  recorded in centimeters  is also measured at the upper arm midpoint 
A measuring tape encircles the arm and is pulled snugly without pinching the skin 
Arm muscle circumference is calculated with the formula 
All values are converted to centimeters

While sophisticated methods are available for determining the relative contributions of water  fat  bone  and protoplasm to total body weight  these methods are too cumbersome for routine clinical use or epidemiologic studies 
For clinical purposes  weight  height  and skinfold thickness are used to estimate the degree of adiposity in evaluating for obesity and  along with arm circumference  to estimate depletion of energy and protein stores in the malnourished hospitalized patient 
Body weight alone is a poor measure of adiposity because weight is strongly correlated with height 
Clinicians have generally relied on height and weight tables to determine the appropriateness of a patient's weight for his or her height 
The  Metropolitan Life Desirable Weight Tables in use for the past two decades were based on actuarial data from the  Build and Blood Pressure Study of insured individuals 
The term ideal weight was coined by Metropolitan Life to encourage people to keep their weight below the average for the insured population 
The ideal weight was that associated with the maximum longevity for each height and frame size 
Guidelines for determining frame size were not given and actually represented an arbitrary division of the population into the low small frame  middle two medium frame  and highest quartiles large frame 
In fact  there are few studies assessing the contribution of frame size to weight 
The body mass index BMI = weightheight has been promoted as a superior index of relative weight 
The revised  Metropolitan Life Height and Weight Tables are based on the  Build Study of 
million persons insured by  U S 
and Canadian life insurance companies over  years 
The  tables include guidelines for determining frame size from elbow breadth 
An estimate of frame size can be made by encircling the patient's wrist at the widest point with the examiner's thumb and index finger 
If the fingers overlap  the frame size is small  if they just meet  the frame size is medium  and if the fingers do not meet  the frame size is large 
The insurance tables have their limitations as representations of ideal weight 
In fact  the  revised tables no longer carry the term desirable in their title 
The insurance data represent a sample of a selected group of healthy middle class individuals 
The average weight of the sample is less than the average found in more representative cross sectional studies 
In general  obesity is readily diagnosed by examination of the naked patient 
The height and weight tables  despite their limitations  provide useful reference standards  as several studies have shown an increased mortality with weights greater than  above or below the actuarial ideal weights 
Their use in determining weight goals should be tempered by clinical judgment 
Patients with hyperlipidemia  hypertension  or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus may have an increased percentage of body fat and may benefit from weight loss despite weights within the reference range 
There may also be a group of healthy obese persons who frequently have strong family histories for obesity and who themselves have been obese in the past  but who have managed to reduce their weight and maintain it at a level where fat cell size is normal and where there are no identifiable risk factors Callaway 
These persons would be unlikely to benefit from further efforts at weight reduction 
Because of the wide variation in body size  comparison of weight to a reference standard may be less useful in assessing the adequacy of caloric intake than determining the percentage of usual body weight and the rate of weight loss 
Weights less than  of usual are evidence of significant malnutrition 
Almost one half of the body's fat is distributed as subcutaneous fat 
As the thickness of this layer bears some relationship to total body fat  and as the loss of subcutaneous fat occurs proportionately with dieting  measurement of skinfold thickness is a relatively simple and practical method of determining the extent of fatness 
The triceps and sub scapular skinfolds are commonly used  and age specific tables derived from cross sectional studies provide reference values for each measurement and their sum 
While the presence of obesity is usually obvious with excessive weights  moderate degrees of overweight may be due to increased muscularity e g   football players 
Skin fold thickness may be used to supplement weight and height measurements 
Measurement of body fat is also useful to estimate the duration and severity of inadequate dietary intake as fat is lost slowly in malnutrition 
Mid upper arm muscle circumference is a reliable index of skeletal protein mass 
It does not take into account bone and other nonmuscle tissues below the skinfold or the shape of the arm  but is useful as a comparative measurement for which standards have been developed 
The measurement is subject to some lack of reproducibility between observers 
In addition  applying standards derived from healthy populations will overestimate protein calorie malnutrition 
Hospitalized patients often have chronic illness that may result in disuse or denervation atrophy and subsequent loss of muscle mass despite adequate protein stores 
Laboratory assessment of nutritional status may include determinations of serum albumin  transferrin  creatinine height index  total lymphocyte count  and skin tests for cell mediated immunity 
These tests all suffer from a lack of specificity 
At least one study has shown that a history and physical by a well trained physician was as reliable in determining the presence of protein calorie malnutrition as a complete anthropometric and laboratory work up Baker et al 
The changes of aging may complicate the nutritional assessment of the elderly 
Most standards are derived from younger populations 
The mean height of older age groups is less than the height of younger groups 
This can be attributed to genetic and environmental influences on the current aged and to the loss of stature that occurs with aging 
The loss of height is primarily due to shortening of the spinal column from thinning of the disks and osteoporosis 
Accurate measurement may be difficult to obtain because of kyphosis or illness that precludes standing erect 
Loss of height may be an important indicator of osteoporosis 
Serial heights are an essential measurement in the elderly 
There tends to be a progressive decline in weight after age   accompanied by a decrease in lean body mass and an increase in adipose tissue 
Most of the increased fat is deposited around the internal organs 
There is some evidence that skinfold measurements on the trunk are more reliable predictors of body fat in elderly males  while extremity measures may be more accurate in elderly females 
Growth proceeds in a nonlinear fashion with the greatest rate immediately after birth 
There is a general deceleration throughout childhood  except for a small mid childhood growth spurt and a prominent adolescent growth spurt  after which the epiphyses close and maximum height is attained 
The regulation of growth is a complex  incompletely understood phenomenon with genetic  hormonal  and environmental influences 
Although racial differences exist  it is not clear how much of these differences are environmentally determined 
Some of the hormonal influences on growth are outlined below 
  Thyroid hormone appears to moderate growth by regulating synthesis and secretion of growth hormone  as well as by a permissive action for the effects of growth hormone 
Thyroid hormone is necessary to develop normal adult proportions 
 Growth hormone increases chondrogenesis  protein synthesis  and cell profileration 
Its growth promoting actions may be mediated through somatomedins 
 Insulin acts primarily to preserve the metabolic homeostasis necessary for growth rather than as a direct growth stimulator 
 Glucocorticoid oversecretion can inhibit growth  apparently by a direct effect on target tissues  rather than by inhibiting growth hormone actions or release 
 Androgens have a complementary action with growth hormone and are potent growth stimulators in pre puberty 
However  they also accelerate epiphyseal maturity 
Administration of androgens may lead to early epiphyseal closure and loss of growth potential 
Hypogonadism may cause a delay in closure and result in long limb length 
 Estrogens have an inhibitory effect on linear growth and a stimulatory effect on epiphyseal maturity 
Estrogens may inhibit somatomedin secretion

If obesity is defined as  of actuarial ideal weight  then cross sectional surveys indicate that  to  of men and women in the United States are overweight 
The prevalence increases with age until middle age  after which it declines 
Obesity is more prevalent in women than men  particularly in women of lower socioeconomic status 
Most studies have shown an increased mortality in overweight individuals 
Recent studies have shown the minimum mortality around the average weight with excess mortality in those  below or  above the average weight 
In the  revision of the Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables  the ideal weights were adjusted upward  to  to a slightly plump weight 
Table 
summarizes some of the health consequences of obesity 
Although obesity results from an intake of calories in excess of energy expended  there are undoubtedly genetic  metabolic  endocrine  and behavioral influences 
The onset of obesity early in life results in hyperplasia of fat cells  which may lead to a more intractable form of obesity 
Emotional disorders and maladaptive eating patterns may also contribute to weight gain 
Although patients frequently believe that their weight gain must be due to a glandular problem  endocrine disorders are infrequently identified 
While a thorough history including dietary history and physical are appropriate for all patients presenting with obesity  endocrine studies should be reserved for patients with features suggestive of a primary endocrine disorder see Table 
Protein calorie malnutrition is present in an alarming number of seriously ill hospitalized patients  with a prevalence as high as  in some surveys 
Malnutrition may contribute to poor wound healing  decreased immune competence with increased susceptibility to sepsis  hypoventilation  decreased tolerance of chemotherapy  and delayed ambulation 
Many illnesses predispose patients to malnutrition 
The most common mechanism is decreased nutritional intake that may be related to appetite loss associated with illness and drugs  surgical procedures  gastrointestinal disorders  swallowing problems  and impaired ability to self feed secondary to neurologic and psychiatric illness 
In addition  illnesses such as malabsorption  protein losing enteropathies  diabetes  and nephrotic syndrome may result in increased loss of nutrients 
The hypermetabolic state associated with major illness can also increase protein calorie requirements 
Cancers may cause malnutrition by any of these mechanisms and  in addition  may have independent effects on metabolic processes 
Marasmus and kwashiorkor like syndromes may be present in malnourished patients 
Marasmus is seen with prolonged starvation  when total dietary intake is inadequate 
It is often seen with severe chronic illnesses  and these patients are generally recognizable by their weight loss  muscle wasting  loss of fat deposits  and general cachectic appearance 
Kwashiorkor like malnutrition occurs when the diet contains ample calories but little protein e g   prolonged administration of dextrose containing intravenous fluids 
In acute depletion  obesity may be present  and skeletal mass may be only slightly depleted 
Laboratory tests of visceral proteins and immune competence are usually depressed 
Malnutrition may also be seen in outpatients who are chronically ill or alcoholic  as well as in some elderly individuals and children on inadequate diets 
Anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders may result in life threatening malnutrition 
The decision to investigate a child with short stature is determined more by the pattern of growth than by the current centile 
A low growth velocity must always be investigated as a previously normal child may stop growing for several years before falling below the rd percentile 
Poor growth is a nonspecific sign of disease 
Most children with short stature do not suffer from endocrinological or genetic disorders  but represent the bottom  of the normal distribution of height 
These are instances of hereditary short stature 
Many of these children have parents with short stature  and there are growth charts that take parental height into account 
Nutritional deficiency and hypoxia are common causes of short stature and may be associated with chronic pulmonary  cardiac  gastrointestinal  renal  or metabolic disease  as well as with a poor environment 
Chromosomal abnormalities are usually associated with characteristic features 
Down's syndrome trisomy  is characterized by growth retardation  mental deficiency  cardiac abnormalities  and a flat face with a short nose and epicanthic skin folds 
Turner's syndrome XO karyotype is associated with a female phenotype  short stature  sexual infantilism  and characteristic facies 
Turner variants may have short stature without the usual stigmata 
The skeletal dysplasias are characterized by short stature with abnormal skeletal proportions 
They include a large variety of disorders  a complete discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter 
Achondroplasia is the most common dysplasia  in   births 
It is an autosomal dominant trait  but  of cases represent new mutations 
These individuals have proximal limb shortening  short stature  and large heads with frontal bossing 
Hurler's syndrome is a disorder of mucopolysaccharide distribution with associated skeletal abnormalities  a large skull  and typical facies 
Dysmorphic dwarfism includes a variety of syndromes of unknown etiology with intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation 
Hypopituitary dwarfism may result from primary pituitary disease  hypothalamic dysfunction including cases secondary to psychosocial deprivation or end organ resistance to growth hormone 
These children tend to have normal skeletal proportions for their age 
Hypothyroidism is characterized by complete growth cessation and infantile skeletal proportions 
The other physical findings of hypothyroidism may be subtle 
The most serious consequences result when thyroid deficiency occurs early in life 
Cushing's syndrome may be due to endogenous or exogenous steroids 
The other clinical signs may be less prominent in children than in adults 
There are few pathologic causes of tall stature 
Tall stature is less often a concern to parents and children than short stature  however  girls with familial tall stature and a predicted height of greater than six feet may be considered for treatment with estrogens 
Klinefelter's syndrome is associated with normal growth velocity  long legs  small testes  and poor mental performance 
Marfan's syndrome is characterized by above average height  long limbs  arm span greater than height  lower segment greater than the upper segment  ocular abnormalities  and aortic aneurysm 
Giantism is caused by excess growth hormone secretion before epiphyseal closure 
These individuals have rapid linear growth and later develop the coarse features of acromegaly 
Miscellaneous causes of tall stature include homocystinuria  total lipodystrophy  XYY karyotype  thyrotoxicosis  exogenous obesity  sexual precocity and virilization syndromes  cerebral giantism  and BeckwithWiedemann syndrome
