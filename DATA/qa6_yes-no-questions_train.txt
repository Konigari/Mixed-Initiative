1 Okay.
2 Okay,
3 we are supposed to talk about places we like to go.
4 So I'm going,
5 and where are you from, where are you calling from?
6 I'm calling from, uh, Provo, Utah,
7 but I'm from Plano, Texas.
8 Oh, you are from Plano.
9 My sister lives in Plano.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, really?
2 Yes,
3 her husband is the new Director of Admissions at, uh, University of Texas at Dallas.
4 Oh, wow.
5 Yeah,
6 so,
7 Anyway, so, where's your favorite place to go?
8 My grandparents live there.
9 That's generally our usual summer vacation.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Where in Arizona?
2 Uh, Tempe.
3 Okay,
4 I've never been to Tempe.
5 So,
6 That's where I'd like to go.
7 What do you like about Tempe?
8 Uh, mainly just being with family is it.
9 We just hang out
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and my grandparents have a pool
2 so we go swimming
3 and, uh,
4 Pretty hot isn't it, in the summer?
5 Yeah
6 but we keep cool just by going swimming
7 and it's fun to be with my cousins.
8 They're up there also, my grandparents and my cousins.
9 That's good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 So,
3 Been to Hawaii?
4 No,
5 have you?
6 Yes,
7 in fact, I just got some reservations.
8 I'm going to go for, uh, almost two weeks this winter.
9 Oh, my goodness.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes.
2 It's the longest,
3 well actually I lived there,
4 so I was there longer,
5 but two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there,
6 so I'm kind of looking forward to that one.
7 Wow.
8 Around Christmas time?
9 Uh, no,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 in March.
2 Oh.
3 We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way.
4 Wow.
5 Yeah,
6 so I think, I would like to go to Arizona.
7 I mean, I was in Phoenix in January, last January
8 but it was rainy and icky.
9 Oh, really?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 It was the coldest it's been there ever in January
2 I think. It's very cold.
3 So, do you travel a lot
4 But, I would like to go to Tempe.
5 or,
6 Do we travel a lot?
7 Uh, some, yeah.
8 Well, I've been a, I was a travel agent.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean, I have been up until just a few months ago.
2 But I'm thinking of going back to work
3 Huh.
4 Yeah.
5 So you know a lot of good vacation spots, huh.
6 I I know a lot of good places to go.
7 But you definitely need to go to Hawaii.
8 Very definitely.
9 That's your favorite?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yes,
2 it is my favorite.
3 My husband hasn't been to Europe yet
4 and I'd like to take him there.
5 And, but he's traveled all over the United States
6 and I haven't.
7 Like, I haven't been down south.
8 I'd like to go to New Orleans.
9 Have you been there?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I haven't.
2 Where, where do you live?
3 We, I live in Yakima, Washington.
4 Wow.
5 So it's cold and rainy today.
6 It's yucky.
7 Um.
8 But we've had some pretty nice weather.
9 We played tennis outdoors until last week,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 so that's a pretty good deal.
2 Um.
3 So do you go to school in Provo, Utah?
4 I do.
5 Do you use NuSkin skin care.
6 They're located in Provo.
7 I work for NuSkin
8 Do you?
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I'm a NuSkin person.
2 Oh, really?
3 Yeah,
4 I sell NuSkin, too.
5 I, I am my only
6 Oh, my goodness.
7 and best
8 not only and best
9 but I'm my best customer.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Great
2 Since we're not supposed to talk about this, though, is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream?
3 Uh,
4 Do you know?
5 I don't,
6 probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing I would use.
7 I have that, too.
8 I'm forty-two,
9 I need something,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I need more.
2 Than the intensive eye?
3 Yeah.
4 I didn't know if there was anything else.
5 And I use the Celltrex.
6 Uh-huh.
7 But anyway,
8 well, yes,
9 NuSkin is wonderful.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Good,
2 yes.
3 I think it's a wonderful product.
4 Do you use it?
5 I do,
6 yeah,
7 we get free products every month
8 so,
9 Oh, my gosh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's great.
2 Right, right
3 now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month, free products
4 so,
5 Yeah,
6 oh, yeah.
7 I've worked there about a year.
8 That's good.
9 Are they good to work for?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 they're wonderful to work for.
3 That's great.
4 Yep
5 Anyway, so we're supposed to be talking about places to go
6 and you have not been to Europe.
7 Do you go to school?
8 Uh-huh.
9 Do you ski?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I ski, yes.
2 I've,
3 Ski,
4 you probably ski very well in Utah.
5 No,
6 I don't
7 Actually since I grew up in Texas I've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about three times. well, five times each season.
8 Uh.
9 Why did you move to Utah?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You're going, oh, you are going to school? At B Y U,
2 Yeah,
3 I,
4 is that where B Y U is?
5 Uh-huh.
6 Yep.
7 Okay,
8 I know some people that went to B Y U.
9 That's great.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Pretty good.
2 I do like to ski.
3 Pretty, pretty down there. Huh?
4 Yeah,
5 I, I said I do like to ski.
6 So, where, have you skied?
7 And it's, it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go.
8 Sure.
9 If you like that kind of thing
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Sure,
2 so you're a sophomore. Or junior?
3 I am actually a junior. Beginning of my junior year.
4 You're a junior.
5 Good for you.
6 So,
7 What are you studying?
8 Nursing.
9 Good for you.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You sound like a girl that has it together.
2 I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get married.
3 Because when you get married, you won't have the money or the time.
4 You think,
5 I know.
6 So just, you know,
7 don't, don't be in any hurry.
8 I'm not, I'm not.
9 You really should go to Europe.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college
2 and that was just,
3 I, I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car
4 and I took the trip.
5 And
6 And it was great?
7 uh, I traveled with a group of sixteen other students.
8 Actually they, there was two other graduating seniors besides myself,
9 and we just had a ball.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay,
2 you want to start?
3 Yeah,
4 I might as well.
5 Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, uh, this, this, the ozone layer, uh, uh, issue.
6 Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons,
7 and that, uh, rather bothers me that, uh, I was in, in effect, uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago.
2 Right,
3 right,
4 and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive,
5 uh, they could be made, uh, you know, inexpensive and lots of it, uh,
6 and in that, and its properties were great, uh, with, uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work.
7 Um.
8 So.
9 Have they stopped that practice now?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Well, course there's a, a tremendous number of refrigerators and excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, uh, utilizing freon twelve,
2 and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems.
3 But, uh, there's, you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera.
4 Yeah.
5 And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going to be quite a while before we can, uh, undo this.
6 Now, that could spawn several good industries and help, pull us out of this recession,
7 but you got to have people that can make, you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion.
8 So, so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound.
9 Oh, yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Because as I say, there's a, there's a
2 well, how many, uh, uh, families own a refrigerator,
3 and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from and how many people, especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with air conditioning.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah
6 yeah.
7 I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks,
8 and, uh, the only reason I didn't, uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, uh, most of your, uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I mean,
2 so, uh, that's why I stayed in, stayed more towards, uh, uh,
3 and that's a polluting type deal too, is the excessive, um, you know, uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, uh, like knocking on a really make, uh, make a mess.
4 Um, yeah,
5 yeah,
6 I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke,
7 Uh-huh.
8 and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but that, that particular bothers me.
2 Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel that's, uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, uh,
3 Uh-huh.
4 because when you, when diesel is burned it's it,
5 you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine
6 it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. You know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone.
7 Oh.
1 What?
2 Do you want to start?
3 Uh, you hit, you hit, uh,
4 it doesn't matter.
5 Um, we're discussing the capital punishment, I believe.
6 Right.
7 You are right.
8 Yeah.
9 I, I suppose I should have,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, which
2 I am, am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, yeah,
5 uh, I, uh, I guess, I, I hate to see anyone die, uh
6 Uh-huh.
7 but, uh, I guess these people that go around and, and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to, to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.
8 I, I agree.
9 I, I'm,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 capital
2 the, the,
3 capital punishment is necessary in, in many cases
4 but, uh, the,
5 it's not a deterrent, um, or our jails would not be so full.
6 There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row.
7 Uh-huh.
8 I think it needs to be something, uh, uh, a throwback to where they did a, uh, public execution where it's visible.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh, something, you know, not gruesome
2 but, but something more where people know that it, it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people.
3 If you committed a certain crime, you were going to receive a death penalty
4 and it was going to happen to you.
5 Yeah.
6 No stays of execution.
7 No, no loopholes,
8 no,
9 Well, and even, even that I don't really know if that would help.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think a lot of these people do it, uh, mainly because of, of T V
2 and,
3 Notoriety.
4 the double reason they, they see it being done on T V and also the fact of, of notoriety.
5 I mean, they become well known.
6 They are almost like, like a big star.
7 yes,
8 but, but they, they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.
2 Uh-huh.
3 That they are going to write a book.
4 They are going to go on talk shows
5 they're
6 that, that, that's a reward uh, for a heinous crime rather than, uh, having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life.
7 Yeah.
8 Right.
9 In, in complete, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 of any notoriety.
2 Yeah.
3 Well, I, I, I think if they went according to, uh, the BIBLE where it does say, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life,
4 Uh-huh.
5 Right.
6 uh, you take a life you give yours.
7 Right.
8 Uh, uh, that's for sure.
9 Uh, there's exceptions to the rule
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I mean if, if it's an accidental taking then, uh, you look at that
2 but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and, and do it out of pure pleasure uh, I don't, uh, like to see that.
3 Uh-huh.
4 I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent,
5 it is a deterrent in the, in the sense that that person will never do it again
6 Well, yes,
7 they will.
8 Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.
9 It,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Oh, ,
2 well, that's correct,
3 yes.
4 if, if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is, it is executed.
5 The death penalty.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeah.
8 But, but the, the, the chances are not great that that will happen.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.
2 Uh-huh,
3 yeah.
4 Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.
5 I, I, I guess I been thinking about it
6 and I don't have a definite opinion
7 but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's right.
2 Just for pleasure too
3 and I guess you've got to look at something like that.
4 Yes.
5 Do they deserve to, uh, remain on this earth too?
6 Why, you know, you could carry it to that if, uh, if they are a repeat offender
7 and, and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.
8 Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, um, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,
1 Okay.
2 Wonderful touch tone telephone there.
3 Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?
4 Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies,
5 therefore, my, my reading pleasures are quite wide.
6 Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS HIGHWAY, which is, uh, very colorful, and, uh, not being a native of Texas, but being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the different areas of the of the, of the state by reading it.
7 Oh.
8 Right,
9 I've read that one too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I only had a subscription once,
2 but my mother always gave me hers
3 and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.
4 Oh yeah,
5 it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.
6 It's pretty, pretty neat.
7 Um, oh, I like photography, um, magazines.
8 I don't take a subscription or anything like that.
9 Um, things, oh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
2 and, and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house
3 Uh-huh.
4 and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it,
5 but, uh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 How about yourself?
8 Well, um, I have an interest in art,
9 so I, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, that's great.
2 And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.
3 Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.
4 Uh-huh.
5 That's fairly interesting.
6 I bet that would be, rather interesting.
7 Uh, that's, uh, self improvement,
8 that's, that's well, that's kind of a hobby
9 but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
3 How about you?
4 Um, well I hate to,
5 yes,
6 I do
7 We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes
8 and, and they give you books
9 and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 It talks about, uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments.
2 Yeah.
3 Uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
6 and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.
7 You're my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.
8 Right.
9 Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all, you know, betters yourself.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah,
4 well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I mean they are
7 but I don't label it as such.
8 Like what for example.
9 Well, I don't know, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,
2 but, uh, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know getting your, yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it.
3 Sure.
4 Sure.
5 How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big,
6 okay.
7 Yes.
8 So those are self improvements.
9 Sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L it
2 Um.
3 and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.
4 And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers
5 So it's, it's it's interesting,
6 here again it's, it's casual reading
7 and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff
8 and it's really excellent fast reading
9 and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah.
4 If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.
5 I don't know,
6 I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King.
7 That's a little, little heavy for me.
8 Yeah,
9 they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,
2 but, uh, it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.
3 Yeah.
4 I have a hard time finishing books.
5 Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.
6 Uh-huh.
7 In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways .
8 Oh, yeah,
9 you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 but, uh, I think sometimes the word is a little over used
2 Exactly, exactly right.
3 but,
4 Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.
5 I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
6 and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,
7 Yeah.
8 but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.
9 Okay,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well, any other comments.
2 Uh, not that I can think of.
3 Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit.
1 Well, have you seen a new movie lately?
2 Well, uh, I am a student
3 and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh, I I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.
6 Okay.
7 I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.
8 Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?
9 Uh, let's see.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.
2 Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.
3 Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.
4 What have you seen recently?
5 Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.
6 Yes.
7 Okay.
8 Yes.
9 What did you think of that one?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Enjoyed that quite a bit.
2 Um, I thought the, uh, the the cinematography was excellent.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, the story was,
5 uh, though it tended to be a little one sided uh, it was good.
6 Yeah.
7 Uh, it was, it was believable.
8 I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,
9 and that's when the movie was filmed,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh-huh.
2 and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,
3 uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre
4 Uh-huh.
5 and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.
6 In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.
7 Wow.
8 Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,
9 and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all looked at the buffalo,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it was really neat.
2 But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre
3 Uh-huh.
4 and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know
5 Uh-huh.
6 or, you know, they'd start recognizing people.
7 They knew, they knew the extras or the,
8 Yeah.
9 So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I'd go now, now which one could that be you know,
2 Uh-huh.
3 and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,
4 Scope.
5 Right.
6 Exactly.
7 Uh-huh.
8 So, but I, I thought it was a good film.
9 But you are right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I think, I think it was very one sided.
2 It, it was,
3 but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.
4 I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,
5 Sure.
6 and it's just, shoot the Indians,
7 and they are always the savages.
8 Right.
9 So,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night
2 and, it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Um, but it was an interesting movie.
5 Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?
6 Yes.
7 Now I thought that was a good show.
8 Yeah.
9 That was, that was a good movie.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.
2 Yeah.
3 Kind of,
4 It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing
5 or, uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,
6 but it was an enjoyable movie.
7 It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS series, you know, just something a little different,  yet  believable.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Yes.
2 You're bringing it,
3 I don't know,
4 I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.
5 But, yeah,
6 I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,
7 and, uh,
8 Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,
9 are you going to see this next one that's coming out?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Oh, definitely.
2 Have you seen the rest?
3 Yes.
4 I think I've missed one.
5 I'm not sure,
6 but I think I've missed one.
7 I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,
8 and they showed all five in a row.
9 Was that here in Dallas?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, they had it everywhere,
2 uh, every major city had one theater that did it
1 Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline
2 Uh-huh.
3 and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I agree with that.
7 Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
8 You were?
9 and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh.
3 You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah,
6 yeah.
7 From what I understand, they act up pretty bad
8 Yeah,
9 that's right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's right.
2 What, uh,  grade is your daughter in?
3 My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
4 Uh-huh,
5 uh-huh.
6 and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
2 Oh, no,
3 uh-huh.
4 They always had a paddle in our school.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Well, they, they just don't do that any more.
7 I know.
8 But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 yeah.
3 And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid
4 and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
5 Uh-huh,
6 uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?
2 Yes
3 supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,
4 and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
5 Uh-huh.
6 You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.
7 I guess we shouldn't get into that
8 but, um, and what else, um,
9 I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
3 Uh-huh.
4 No.
5 Really?
6 Oh, yeah,
7 Ooh.
8 I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
2 Uh-huh. Um.
3 Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.
4 I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
5 Oh, I do too,
6 I think they're doing real good job.
7 Uh-huh,
8 so.
9 But, then, what do I know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I don't have any kids.
2 No,
3 none at all
4 Yeah,
5 okay,
6 so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
7 Oh, yeah
8 Yeah.
1 Well, tell me about your home.
2 Okay.
3 Uh, right now we're living in,
4 well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.
5 And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,
8 but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.
9 So it was enough.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.
3 Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
4 Yeah.
5 So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house
6 and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
7 Huh.
8 And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
9 It sounds nice.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It's, uh, pretty nice.
2 Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
3 Oh, yeah?
4 Yeah.
5 It was a,
6 Landmark is the one who built it.
7 Yeah.
8 Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 That's true.
2 And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
3 Exactly what happened to them.
4 I'm building my own house.
5 Oh, that's nice.
6 And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
7 Oh, really.
8 Yeah.
9 Are you doing it yourself?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Wow.
3 I used to be a builder.
4 Oh, that's nice.
5 And I retired about five years ago  and  started college.
6 Oh, I  see.
7 Huh.
8 And now I'm a college educated builder
9 There's still no work, you know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yeah.
2 So, uh,  you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
3 so I did.
4 That's great.
5 And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
6 is that so?
7 I didn't know that.
8 You can borrow the  money to pay somebody else to build your house
9 but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Well that sounds kind of dumb.
2 Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
3 Uh-huh.
4 and then it doesn't sell
5 and then the  bank's  holding the bag.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah.
8 Well.
9 Huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to  costs three times as much. Right?
2 That's right
3 Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
4 Yeah,
5 that's true.
6 But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.
7 It's designed to be added on to.
8 Uh-huh.
9 That's good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yeah.
2 Well, I figure it's just me and my wife
3 but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,
4 so  I want  to have a shop.
5 Yeah.
6 How big a lot do you got it on?
7 Ten acres.
8 Wow.
9 That's nice.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's real nice.
2 Well, yeah.
3 It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
4 He's on the other side of a hill.
5 Oh.
6 And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
7 Seriously.
8 God.
9 That's pretty good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy
2 but, you know, he's
3 Uh-huh.
4 I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 And, uh,
8 Oh, that's pretty good.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
4 Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
5 Uh-huh.
6 And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
7 Yeah.
8 But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I have not had to use the heat.
2 Wow.
3 Because it's all geothermal.
4 Yeah.
5 That's pretty good.
6 And with all the,
7 see I've got,
8 on the south side is all glass.
9 Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah.
2 I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.
3 So it's almost all glass.
4 Wow.
5 And,  uh,
6 My  wife would love that
7 Oh, yeah.
8 I mean,  you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
9 She loves  lots of windows.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's great.
2 So, uh,
3 Is it a single story?
4 Well, not really.
5 It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
6 Oh, I see.
7 So the first, you know,
8 the, the, the,
9 what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Um, I see.
3 And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
4 Oh.
5 So I've got a pretty good grade there.
6 Yeah.
7 And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
1 Okay,
2 do you, uh, think we should go metric?
3 Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.
4 It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,
5 Yeah.
6 obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens
7 and things make sense.
8 Um, it's, it's a switch.
9 The problem would just be the switch over.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 I think that the, I think what,
3 I mean, I don't know what happened last time.
4 I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something
5 and,
6 Right.
7 That's when I was in the elementary school years
8 and we all, We all learned that metric
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 me too.
2 and they were ready,
3 we were going to be metric
4 and,
5 Right,
6 and, and I don't quite know why it failed.
7 Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.
8 Right.
9 You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out
2 so,
3 So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric
4 Yeah.
5 and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.
6 We have metric cola now,
7 Right,
8 I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.
9 you can buy that
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and you can,
2 You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.
3 So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,
4 but no one talks about, you know, uh,
5 you buy nine by twelve frames,
6 you don't buy centimeter length frames, and cooking pans.
7 Right.
8 And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers,
9 you don't say,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.
2 Uh-huh .
3 Right,
4 fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.
5 Yeah.
6 I would, I would be total loss.
7 Yeah.
8 That's,
9 I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Right.
2 and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed
3 and, pardon my expression there, but, uh, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.
6 Yeah,
7 it really would.
8 It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could I mean
9 because I think our generation could make a change.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 It would be difficult,
3 but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.
4 Right.
5 That's
6 Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.
7 Right.
8 And if they kept it up,
9 so let's say, imagine they had kept going,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.
2 Right.
3 Not like could use it comfortably right now,
4 but I could convert, you know,
5 I could carry around a little conversion card or something
6 and, I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn,
7 Right
8 and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And now I think there are enough people,
2 you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,
3 and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.
4 We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck,
5 but it's for the better
6 and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
7 That's true.
8 That makes sense.
9 I don't know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I, I would hope it would, uh,
2 it seems like it's a reasonable system.
3 I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.
4 Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,
5 and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.
6 Right
7 When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,
8 Centimeters.
9 and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 But I wonder if, if,
3 So all the dieters would be happy
4 But yeah
5 right
6 I only weigh sixteen today.
7 That's,
8 Yeah.
9 But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,
2 so start, you know, from now,
3 like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something.
4 Right.
5 And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that, tells you how tall the robbers are when they, to hold it up.
6 That's right.
7 I know the,
8 and, oh, yeah,
9 I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 You have to be under.
3 Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh,
4 see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.
5 Right.
6 this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.
7 That's right.
8 Just so you'll know,
9 It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?
3 I know England is not metric.
4 But I don't know.
5 I, I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in England,
6 England is not?
7 Oh.
8 all that began back there,
9 and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 but I mean,
3 but, but virtually the rest of the world is.
4 I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.
5 Right.
6 I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans
7 and we're supposed to be, you know,
8 We're the trend setters in the world.
9 I don't know why we, We haven't changed to the sensible system.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's right,
2 and, and now we're backwards.
3 I don't know.
4 No,
5 I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.
6 Right.
7 Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything,
8 is it?
9 It,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No,
2 actually, no.
3 Um, let's see,
4 it's,
5 Well, pounds,
6 I don't even know what that,
7 I don't know.
8 Oh, yeah,
9 I, I always forget.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.
2 I just sort of make it up.
3 See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.
4 It's,
5 I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from,
6 Right
7 Those, those wouldn't be a problem.
8 It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.
9 A lot of stuff,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Let's see,
2 how many cups equal that?
3 I, I have no idea.
4 I just, uh,
5 I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.
6 Right
7 I don't, I didn't even know that
8 That's all I know.
9 I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I, I had two friends,
2 and, I had more friends than that,
3 but two friends of mine in college,
4 I had a lot more than two,
5 I promise.
6 Well, that's good.
7 Um, we opened a jelly bean business.
8 Oh.
9 And we sold jelly beans,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know,
2 we, we didn't we didn't bother buying a scale.
3 Right.
4 We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.
5 Right.
6 And we, we didn't bother buying a scale,
7 and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major
8 and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around,
9 and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?
2 Gee, I think, I think he the calculation at home,
3 and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.
4 Um.
5 If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.
6 Right.
7 So, so we were giving them a little too much,
8 but that was our general tendency anyway.
9 Well, that's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you all are nice business
2 Yeah,
3 well, we were, you know, we were in,
4 it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school,
5 we really didn't, make, you know,
6 Right.
7 I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after, after an entire semester,
8 Right
9 but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Probably ate all your merchandise too.
2 Yeah,
3 we, we, we tended to eat a lot,
4 and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it,
5 and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and he got into a snowball fight, with the jelly beans nearby,
8 and he just,
9 and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
1 Uh, well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?
2 We, uh,
3 well, uh, my, my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class.
4 Uh-huh.
5 He's an aerobics instructor. And, um, is going to be, uh, entering North Texas for uh, a Kinesiology program there. *two utts?
6 Uh-huh.
7 And, um, the, the
8 how I met him was through, uh, the aerobics class that he used to teach.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You're a student?
2 Yeah,
3 so. I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, uh, person and just very, very athletic.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Enjoying a you know, uh, anything dealing with sports.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 So, and how do you feel about it?
9 Uh, I'm, I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I don't feel like I,
2 I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise.
3 I don't feel well unless I am exercising
4 and I try to do things that involve exercise,
5 but, I very rarely do things like, um,
6 I've never done aerobics or any sort of structured,
7 this is my exercise time
8 Uh-huh.
9 but, I do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know, mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I spend a lot of time
2 and I probably get more exercise than your average person.
3 But, it's not a, a structured sort of thing,
4 and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.
7 Yeah,
8 well I, I've,
9 my,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's the way my mother stands on it.
2 She feels like if it's something that you have to do, you know, if you look at it as if you have to do it, then it becomes, it becomes a chore,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yes,
6 yes.
7 and,  and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.
8 So, um, and I feel that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something, you know,
9 to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 uh-huh.
3 you're a you know
4 calculated down
5 and do your calisthenics, you know, three times a week
6 Uh-huh.
7 or, but, but I do try and, um, I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week.
8 Uh-huh,
9 uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 yeah.
3 Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, it makes it less of a chore?
4 Yeah.
5 And, it's got,
6 and I've always enjoyed dance.
7 Yeah.
8 So it involves, you know,
9 I, I can't get out to dance all the time
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and,
2 Yeah,
3 would that we could
4 Yeah,
5 and it's, and it's more regulated,
6 I mean you're, you're using different parts of the body.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 So, it, it is like dance,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it's structured like that,
2 but you have the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting, so, it makes it easier for me.
3 Yeah.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's move that way, instead of me having to think about it so much.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 Right.
9 You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah.
4 But, I'm like you,
5 I also, um, like to participate in, uh, things like,
6 well, we just went to the, uh, Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend,
7 and, and that was a lot of fun
8 and you get to meet different people, and, um, just get out, you know, out and about,
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 and it's, it, it's something you can all,
5 like our,
6 we did it as a family,
7 so, it was, it was quite a lot of fun.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, biking
2 and I, I, I love to swim,
3 so I love it when, you know, it's swimming weather,
4 Um.
5 and, uh,
6 Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather
7 Oh,
8 I didn't realize that.
9 Uh
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm sorry.
2 Well, I'm in Texas.
3 I, I just assumed that I had,
4 this is the first call I've done,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and, I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from, all over the country.
7 You wouldn't know that
8 Oh, I,
9 So, it's the, it's, it's the, the well it's actually,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's interesting, because there are real regional differences.
2 Um, in California there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,
3 I'm, I'm, I'm not. Uh,
4 there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban California.
5 And, maybe not,
6 I don't know about rural California too well.
7 But, in urban California it's just, you know,
8 for all I know aerobics started out here.
9 I don't know where they actually started,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but they, you know, the craze really picked up big here
2 and before that there was the running craze.
3 And, they,
4 California gets, you know, tends to be a bit faddish,
5 but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So, there must be something to some of them.
8 And, uh,
9 Well, I think people are, are more um, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 people from California seem to be more health motivated all around. I mean, as far as the diet, and everything. Uh, the diet and, uh, just your health consciousness,
2 and, I mean, it just, seems like, uh, a lot of those ideas generate out of California.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Not just exercise, but, health, health related ideas.
5 Yeah.
6 And, I,
7 it's curious, I don't know why, don't know if it's,
8 do you,
9 does California have a,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, there's a sense of it being a package,
2 I think. There, there is a sense of, you know, whole,
3 there's a lot of, you know,
4 you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.
5 And, uh, oh the, the, the University of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER. Which is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
6 Uh-huh.
7 and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.
8 It, it's on fairly solid scientific ground.
9 Uh, it's just dispensed with these distinctions.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so that they, they combined them all together.
2 And, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.
3 Um, there's been some progressive medical schools out here, that have taken that approach.
4 Uh-huh
5 And, um,
6 Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program.
7 Boy,
8 Do you  think the program came  first or the,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that,
2 there's a,
3 I, I can say there's a correlation, but I couldn't say which, which caused the other.
4 They sort of, you know, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.
5 Yeah,
6 the more money they put into it.
7 Yeah.
8 And,
9 I can see that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, cause, I,
2 knowing
3 from institutes of learning like that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere,
4 and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,
5 so,
6 Yeah,
7 yeah.
8 Exactly.
9 And, part of it is California, you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and some of them fizzled out
2 and some of them were disastrous
3 and others of them, um, had an impact on the society around here.
4 And one of the ones that had an impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices,
5 I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved medicine.
6 Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things out here.
7 And, and you could have them around long enough
8 and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.
4 The irony is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise.
5 And, I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks.
6 The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally,  the laborers,
7 Yeah.
8 last thing,
9 Or they're older.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Pardon me.
2 Well, don't you think they tend to be older in the rural
3 I, I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city.
4 Oh,  like everything else.
5 I live in a rural area,   you know, I see that.  *sd
6 Yeah,
7 yeah.
8 The rat race to exercise
9 It's, yeah, it's, it's like it's frantic, to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah,
3 well I, I think so.
4 as a fit person
5 I mean you, you've,
6 if you look at if you look at other cultures,
7 like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China
8 and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all.
9 But, they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. Some sort of relaxation
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, they seem pretty, you know,
4 they don't have the hard body.
5 They don't have that perfect look,
6 and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious.
7 But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some you know,
8 Yeah,
9 And, that, that's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?
2 and, a lot of that is diet.
3 That's true.
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah,
6 I mean, they eat, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat. Um, for economical reasons, not for preference.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Um,
9 Yeah
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and as we can see.
2 Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian
3 so, uh, I've read a lot of information,  knowing that to be true,
4 Yeah
5 am I actually.
6 What's that?
7 I, as am I.
8 Oh, are you also
9 Yes
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well that's, that's good as far as the
2 is that, is that, um, pretty predominant as far as California
3 It is in the urban areas,
4 yes.
5 In the urban areas?
6 Most, for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Oh that's wonderful.
9 Well most, most, sort of modern looking restaurants will,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 you can,
3 That's great,
4 I mean, we, uh,
5 it's such a it's such a trouble here.
6 I mean, you just have to eat at home basically.
7 I was wondering that,
8 because I was actually applying for a job in Texas,
9 and, and, and, uh,  it occurred to me,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well of course in the cities,
2 yeah,
3 well, in the cities,
4 we live close to Dallas,
5 Uh-huh.
6 so, uh, which, you know,
7 you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from all over the country,
8 so, you're going to have a lot of more choices,
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh-huh.
2 but, but, in urban areas it's, you know, steak places,
3 Yeah.
4 Yeah.
1 Are you ready?
2 Uh-huh.
3 She didn't announce that to you?
4 Oh, I didn't, I didn't quite hear all of it.
5 Oh, I see.
6 That's fine.
7 Um, I think, uh, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant
8 Right
9 So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
2 Not for the price?
3 Well, a little bit for the price,
4 Okay.
5 but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places I've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
6 Uh-huh.
7 The
8 Really?
9 Okay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really.
2 Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up
5 and I was like, I'm not eating in there
6 Are you nuts?
7 And, uh, we went in
8 and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
9 My word,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
2 Yeah.
3 Oh.
4 I'm serious.
5 Yeah.
6 Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to Atchafalaya.
7 Uh-huh.
8 No,
9 that's not right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 That's not right.
2 That's not right.
3 Okay.
4 someone in the What's the name of that restaurant?
5 in the background Where at? .
6 someone in the background The Hari Krishna.
7 in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's .
8 Kalachandji's.
9 It's all vegetarian,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it, it was just fabulous.
2 I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
3 Wow.
4 And where was that at, near your,
5 Um, Kalachandji's.
6 It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
7 Where,
8 is it in Dallas?
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Is it in the phone book?
2 Uh, I think so.
3 It should be.
4 Do you know how to spell it?
5 Uh, it starts with a K.
6 Okay.
7 So K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
8 Kalli , K A L L I?
9 Okay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it.
2 I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
3 Uh-huh,
4 section,
5 yes,
6 uh-huh.
7 But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
8 What about fast foods?
9 Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
2 You do, like Arby's?
3 See I don't like Arby's.
4 Oh, really?
5 Why?
6 No,
7 because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.
8 They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver
9 and they, they form it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they make it look like roast beef,
2 and I said, no,
3 thank you.
4 Oh, no,
5 no,
6 no.
7 Someone has been lying to you.
8 What they use is roast beef.
9 Well, that's not what I heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's what,
2 Oh, my goodness.
3 Uh-huh.
4 I'm surprised.
5 My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
6 Really?
7 Yeah.
8 Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
9 Well, that's happened before.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 But we like good uh, we're, we like Mexican food.
3 Okay.
4 And stuff like that.
5 And so, um,
6 How about the health food, uh, restaurants? Well, like this one
7 but it's probably not advertised as such, is it?
8 Or,
9 A health food?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 Health food, uh, restaurants that,
3 Like, like,
4 name one
5 Well well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
6 I'm not sure what you're talking about.
7 But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
8 and they list them.
9 Now there's one restaurant that does that
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 and it's called Rodolfo's
2 over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.
3 Huh.
4 And they have very good food over there.
5 I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that
6 so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 They do list, um, you know, list the fat,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It would be good I think,
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 uh, I don't know how expensive they are.
5 It sounds like that it would probably,
6 Well, it was pretty reasonable.
7 I, it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay,
8 which is kind of high for lunch I guess.
9 For one person?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes.
2 Oh
3 Yes,
4 uh-huh.
5 A bit
6 Yeah.
7 Uh, but, um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, uh, um, men waiters.
8 Yeah,
9 I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, if you're looking for a nice,
2 Uh-huh.
3 Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
4 Yeah.
5 Maybe, maybe that.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah.
8 Yeah.
9 I could see that, then maybe.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
3 Yeah,
4 I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
5 Because they're,
6 Well, they have lunch specials that
7 you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.
8 Yeah.
9 Probably that's true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
2 Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast
3 and it was excellent.
4 It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast
5 and it was
6 Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
7 Oh, it was,
8 That's one of my husband's pet peeves.
9 He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north
2 and that was a no no.
3 Oh, really?
4 And I haven't gotten over that from the north.
5 Oh, catfish is wonderful.
6 I know they say that, that is,
7 Oh, really.
8 but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
9 Really.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and so I kind of stay
2 Why?
3 Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
4 Oh.
5 Huh.
6 and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
7 That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it
8 I,
9 Well, yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So I am,
2 and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah.
5 So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
6 That's true.
7 So I'm, I, you know, I,
8 Oh, on one hand I see that
9 and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah.
3 Corrode.
4 Huh.
5 So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And then they take these things that will rust
8 and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
9 Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 And then they wouldn't think.
3 They were floating around
4 so they shot holes in them to sink them.
5 Oh, dear.
6 And this is before I was born.
7 Wow.
8 So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
9 Sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
3 That's right.
4 Everything we eat.
5 Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it
1 Yes,
2 um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.
3 I was a resident, although very young of the of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.
4 Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.
5 Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,
6 and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.
7 What is your situation?
8 Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.
9 Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.
2 However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.
3 I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.
4 I did Peace Corps training there.
5 Oh that's very interesting.
6 And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student
7 and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California
8 and so the Spanish was no problem.
9 Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.
2 I have,
3 actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico
4 and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.
5 Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid
6 or,
7 Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,
8 you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.
9 I've live abroad most of my life,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.
2 I lived actually in Lebanon,
3 so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.
4 So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.
7 I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.
8 I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi
9 or,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I think so.
2 Okay,
3 that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.
4 Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.
5 I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.
6 Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.
7 But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.
8 I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.
9 How do you feel, though, about,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,
2 but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student
3 and my parents were in the military at the time
4 so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.
5 I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.
6 The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah,
9 those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,
2 I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, I see what you mean,
5 so that,
6 Yeah,
7 taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.
8 Uh, there,
9 I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,
2 I,
3 and I'm thinking in terms of education.
4 But then again each state sets its own
5 and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.
6 Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization
7 and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country
8 so,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, well actually I
2 one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.
3 So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.
4 Uh-huh,
5 well that's interesting too.
6 Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.
7 I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.
8 And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.
9 So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well that's interesting.
2 Right.
3 What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.
4 I think I would be troubled,
5 I suspect, I believe that any of our states,
6 and I,
7 constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.
8 Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.
9 I would be bothered by that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths
2 and that's the, the, the melting pot.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,
5 but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past
6 and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.
9 Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I think that that they would need to reassess that.
2 Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.
3 Uh-huh,
4 uh-huh.
5 That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California
6 and I didn't have any problem with my students
7 but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school
8 and he can't speak a word.
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And so, obviously it didn't work in California.
2 Yeah,
3 but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,
4 Right.
5 and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.
6 Right.
7 But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.
8 Oh, I see.
1 Hi, Cynthia.
2 What did you wear to work today?
3 Um, let's see.
4 What did I wear to work today?
5 Um, actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.
6 So, can you dress pretty casually?
7 Um, on occasion. On occasion.
8 Yeah.
9 Um, I do vary.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, you know, I wear suits,
2 I wear skirts and sweaters.
3 On occasion I can wear jeans.
4 Um, how about you?
5 Well, I, um, run a business out of my home.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So I tend to get up in the morning, put on, sweats, um, do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting with a client, I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again
8 Yes.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.
4 Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.
5 I, um, don't like to wear heels, that really tires me out.
6 I work in a big building.
7 Yeah.
8 So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.
9 Um, you know, in the winter I wear sweaters,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.
2 I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.
3 Right.
4 Right.
5 That's helped me a lot with having,
6 I can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since I'm only, working part-time right now.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Um, but still, it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Right,
3 right,
4 accessories,
5 uh-huh.
6 What about your casual wear?
7 Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
8 Um, yeah
9 mostly.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I mean, at home I predominantly wear laughs while saying remainder of sweatpants and things like that, also.
2 Yeah.
3 It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.
4 Yeah,
5 well, they're, um, you know, they're like
6 Dress shorts.
7 yeah,
8 they're like black corduroy Bermuda shorts.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,
2 and I get really a lot of compliments on them.
3 Um, where I work is predominantly male.
4 Yeah.
5 So, you know, they,
6 their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks, you know, jeans, whatever.
7 Yeah,
8 but ,
9 And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but seems to work for me
2 Yeah,
3 but .
4 In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,
5 it's one of those skorts,
6 you know,
7 it's shorts but it looks like a skirt.
8 Uh-huh.
9 So, I think that'll be good for work, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 It'll be comfortable.
3 Yeah.
4 Yeah.
5 So,
6 I guess down here, uh,
7 we just recently moved to Texas,
8 so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Um, we moved from Colorado where,
2 and I have a closet full of sweaters.
3 Uh-huh.
4 That,
5 Well, see, I live in Virginia.
6 You live in Virginia, now?
7 Uh-huh.
8 Oh, that's interesting.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 So, I'm,
3 you know, like right now, today was in about, you know, the fifties.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.
6 Yeah.
7 I'd like to be able to wear those here.
8 Today it's eighty-eight degrees.
9 Oh, my
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So
2 Uh-huh.
3 Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
4 Uh-huh.
5 Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeah,
8 we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes here.
9 This is pretty unseasonal,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 but, uh, at least, we,
2 you know, it, it, it feels good,
3 it gets, uh,
4 everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.
5 It's nice to get, out and about.
6 Uh-huh.
1 Lucille Hughes.
2 Okay,
3 Lucille, I'm on, on .
4 All right,
5 and what,
6 And our  okay, our topic was,
7 did you hear our topic?
8 Yes.
9 All right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 basketball.
2 Uh-huh.
3 I guess I'm probably a lot like you.
4 I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.
5 Well, I certainly am too.
6 Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.
7 Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.
8 They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.
9 You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I feel like everyone else,
2 Um.
3 I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.
4 It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it.
5 Yes, sir.
6 National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.
7 Oh.
8 Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, uh, coaches?
9 Is that part of our problem?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Yeah,
2 I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, you know.
3 I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft.
4 But,
5 Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,
6 I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.
7 I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do.
8 Roy, who's your next best team,
9 or who do you like after the Mavericks?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Oh, gosh,
2 I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know.
3 Probably the Boston Celtics.
4 I've just always like the Boston Celtics.
5 They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,
6 and, but they're still playing good ball.
7 Well.
8 But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,
9 but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.
2 We certainly need to support them,
3 do we not.
4 Yes,
5 we do. You know.
6 Do you go to the game?
7 Yes,
8 I go to a few games.
9 I haven't been to many.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.
2 I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,
3 and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself
4 Yes,
5 it does
6 I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.
7 Oh, you bet.
8 But, um, maybe next, maybe they can do some.
9 I don't know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 who do they need to trade?
2 Well, I don't know.
3 It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team,
4 they just,
5 I don't know,
6 I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,
7 but, and that can really help the team,
8 but they do that,
9 they trade the nucleus of their power right now.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes, sir,
2 it seems that way to me.
3 I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have
4 and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,
5 but we really need to do something.
6 Well, you know, I feel like, uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.
7 I like their coach.
8 I really like a lot,
9 and I just, I think he deserves a good break.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.
2 I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.
3 I really.
4 Yes, sir.
5 This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.
6 And they have just done as much as they can for that man,
7 and he apparently can't straighten his act out,
8 so we need to, to build on something more positive than that.
9 You bet.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think they're fools if they ever bring him back
2 Oh, I do, too.
3 I certainly would agree to that.
4 Hate to put it that way.
5 I just would not believe him any more.
6 Well, it, um,
7 I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances
8 No.
9 and I think he has gone over the limit.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water
2 but you can't make him drink.
3 So,
4 That's right.
5 And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.
6 Well.
7 But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.
8 It is tragic.
9 I don't, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.
1 Okay.
2 So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?
3 Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.
4 I have a set amount that I, that I save.
5 Actually, well actually there is a, a way,
6 budget our money apparently.
7 The,
8 uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks
9 and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.
2 Right.
3 That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have
4 Uh-huh.
5 I am single,
6 so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,
7 Uh-huh.
8 but  I basically,
9 Really don't  need to.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right,
2 I don't need to.
3 I am the only that I have to keep track of
4 so it makes it a little bit easier.
5 That's right.
6 Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well
7 Uh-huh.
8 and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are
9 and I am pretty consistent from month to month
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.
3 Right.
4 Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,
5 I am in my fifties now,
6 but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,
7 I had four kids
8 and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.
9 Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.
2 For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.
3 Every six months I have to pay car insurance.
4 Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.
5 So I take a set amount.
6 Uh-huh.
7 I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in
8 and I also have got a checking account besides that,
9 but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I put it in parenthesis.
2 I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.
5 Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.
6 Right.
7 And I guess that's a way of budgeting.
8 Yeah.
9 That's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.
2 I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.
3 Like I am,
4 probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.
5 Uh-huh.
6 So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind
7 and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.
2 Right.
3 Uh, you know, we've got two cars.
4 My wife has a car
5 and I like to drive pick up truck.
6 So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.
7 And you know I am constantly making car payments,
8 but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, uh, you know, I get one paid for
2 and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides
3 so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,
4 Huh. Right.
5 but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.
6 Right.
7 Have you thought about, uh, leasing?
8 Well, uh, I have thought about it,
9 but leasing wouldn't,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you know, I don't use it for my business.
2 I see.
3 My wife uses hers just for pleasure
4 and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away
5 Right.
6 so.
7 But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.
8 Yeah,
9 I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh,
2 You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.
5 Right.
6 Yeah,
7 you're right.
8 Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,
9 but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and you got to put put stuff in them you know.
2 That's right.
3 Yeah,
4 mine's, uh, seven years old
5 and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.
6 I had a number of expenses
7 Uh-huh.
8 But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,
1 Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff.
2 I've, read a lot of the, the, uh, astronomy books and, and stuff like that. Uh,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?
8 Uh, to a degree.
9 I haven't kept up as, uh, much as I would like,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 I've just been so busy, uh,
3 Uh-huh.
4 I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,
5 so.
6 Yeah.
7 I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh,
8 it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans
9 and, uh, yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.
2 Yeah.
3 Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,
4 or right now
5 but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
6 Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.
7 Right.
8 Yeah.
9 Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,
2 Yeah,
3 I agree. Uh,
4 as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,
5 and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro
6 Uh-huh.
7 and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.
8 Yeah.
9 It's amazing, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you,
2 it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.
3 Yeah.
4 I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know,
5 he's one of the comedians
6 and and, you know, he, he talks a lot on, on Velcro.
7 Uh-huh,
8 yeah,
9 I've seen him before.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 what would we do without it?
2 Yeah.
3 we were talking about that just the other day.
4 What did we do without it back then?
5 Yeah.
6 I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
7 Yeah.
8 Yeah,
9 there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,
2 concentrated foods for one maybe
3 I Uh, I don't know
4 That's right.
5 That's right.
6 it's also just I've, I've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?
7 Uh-huh.
8 That's true.
9 Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to, to see, you know.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah.
5 I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.
6 It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.
7 Yeah,
8 that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about.
9 I agree.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know like you say we're used to finite things
2 and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.
3 Yeah.
4 But,
5 But, uh, yeah,
6 I would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, enjoy.
7 Yeah.
8 I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 me too.
5 I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.
6 Yeah.
7 I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.
8 Huh.
9 I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, sure.
2 Sure.
3 Of course.
4 That's true.
5 There must be some better better way of doing this.
6 A better place to be or whatever, you know
7 it's,
8 Uh-huh.
9 So you, you are always looking for something better.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 that's true.
3 I know at work, uh, people always complain to me
4 I, well, you are always whining
5 and, it's, I'm always looking for something better. Uh,
6 Yeah
7 There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.
8 That's right.
9 That's right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.
2 Yeah.
3 Because if
4 Well, they are always finding easier ways
5 and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And they are doing it you know, unconsciously.
8 Yeah,
9 I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
1 Okay, um,
2 yeah,
3 one year public service for everybody.
4 Is that, that was it, right?
5 Right.
6 Uh, who wants to start this one?
7 I don't know,
8 I've been, I've been sitting here thinking,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 because it was, you know, took a couple tries before I found somebody.
2 Well, you know, I'm like, I'm not really sure what I think about this.
3 Um, uh, I mean, the first thing is, the uh, if it's going to be mandatory, it's got to be mandatory,
4 I mean, everybody, not just like, you know, poor people and all that, you know. But, you know, senators' sons and all that stuff too.
5 Right,
6 right.
7 I mean, everybody's got to do it.
8 Um, I don't know,
9 it'd probably be, it'd probably be good,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I just don't know if, you know, I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever.
2 I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision.
3 Uh, I mean, that, that doesn't sound right.
4 Um, I guess I see overall beneficial, if, if we're going from that point of view.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Um. you know, in the past,
7 I don't know, I don't know how old you are,
8 but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth.
9 And many of my peers were being drafted.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.
3 But I, I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. Be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service might be available.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And I guess I see that as, as not so much a demand but, but a privilege.
6 It's, it's kind of, uh, uh, It's something,
7 It is, uh,
8 it's, it's
9 since we live here and we all benefit, rich, poor or in between, uh, there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. I just see that as maybe a good idea.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh, and I find ways to, to turn some of that back to, to others.
4 Uh, and I, I guess I, I can't see that as being something to really object to.
5 Well, I guess it would still depend on how,
6 I mean, if, if you're talking about if you're talking about something that's like a full time, you know, one year full time, you know, this is what you do, you know.
7 You're going to go and, and fill pot holes and, you know, and, you know, all that stuff.
8 I mean, I, you know, I don't know
9 I could see a, a full, a a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Things that need to be done, that that could be done in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that. In addition to what one does, uh, besides that.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh-huh.
5 I, I can't, imagine what kind of, uh, uh, bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time,
6 oh, you're going to go to this camp
7 and you're going to, you know,
8 like, um, back in the Depression, the C C C,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 it was needed,
2 it gave some folks some jobs,
3 and we got some great public works out of it.
4 But, um, I don't see that as being necessary now.
5 I can see it being done, uh, on a regular schedule.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh, everybody has to put in so many hours of, uh, public service in a given time, perhaps.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh, I, I guess I see all of us benefiting,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I, I don't see it just relegated to the young.
2 But I see, I, I see so much going on that, that's bad.
3 And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Something that they turn, back.
6 Well,
7 and also, you know, you, you feel more like, you know, you're actually part of the community if you've done something, in it.
8 That's right.
9 You take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those who benefit, besides yourself.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And I, I see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or, or at least the area where the person lives.
3 Uh, definitely.
4 It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're, you're coming in contact with it.
5 It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again, unless I happen to go on vacation, up there.
6 Right.
7 Yeah.
8 It's, it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual, on going.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But as far as putting that into work, I don't want to, I don't want to deal with the, with the heartache of, first of all, getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics, of it.
2 Oh, that would, be a nightmare.
3 And just, I mean, just getting, getting it going.
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah.
6 I, I, see a lot of things like, uh, scouting, uh, Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, things like that, that kind of get into that citizenship, uh, the uh, looking after the environment sort of thing
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And I guess, I don't see, uh, this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in, and would take a turn in.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh
3 Yeah.
4 Do you have kids?
5 no,
6 not yet
7 In about six months we will
8 Oh, well good.
9 you'll have a little time think about that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I guess, I, I have, uh,
2 when I was teaching school I saw many, so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose.
3 And I can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it.
4 Uh-huh.
5 I know you've got to get past that, that grudge attitude that many have,
6 but that's, uh, that would be a part of selling it to the community. uh, parish or however the state was divided up.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Um, I may,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 well I don't know,
2 around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for.
3 Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will, uh, police a, uh a couple of miles of the highway and
4 and I, I've seen it in other states too.
5 Yeah.
6 They have, that here. Um,
7 I don't know,
8 um,
9 they've got, um, in most of the states around here I think, uh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know, down in North Carolina, there was a big controversy for a while, because they, uh, the local chapter of the K K K wanted to, uh, uh, to participate in it
2 and, uh,
3 and there were those that said, No,
4 you can't do that, I'm sure.
5 Well, uh, it was, it was interesting because that's an interesting question, you know.
6 Yeah.
7 Should these people be allowed to or not?
8 I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And I hadn't even thought about that, uh, the, the other end of that.
2 That, that's an interesting, uh, situation.
3 I hadn't thought of that.
4 We had visited relatives in Virginia, not too long ago,
5 and I thought I had seen, when we were traveling around the state, some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up
6 and,
7 Yeah.
8 I think Virginia's got it
9 and I know Maryland does,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and we just, we went to Indianapolis last weekend, and back.
2 And, um, I'm pretty sure I saw, yeah, stuff in Ohio and Indiana about it and Pennsylvania, maybe Pennsylvania,
3 I don't remember for sure now.
4 And I don't know about your part of the country,
5 but, uh, down here in the last, oh, year plus, I, it was beginning with last year's Earth Day There's just been more of a turn toward uh, environmental concerns,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and I work for Texas Instruments.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And they, they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said, Well, it's not feasible,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 it's not a good idea.
3 And, I see that as being, I, I see that as being a, a, a change, uh, for the positive. Kind of along the same line as, as, as the mandatory thing.
4 Yeah.
5 And but then they lost, too much business
6 It's just, thing, a part of everyone's consciousness.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Well, the thing about that is though, it's got a,
9 I mean because it was, I mean it was big, you remember, like in the early seventies and all that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 And, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.
2 And I, I'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.
3 It's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years
4 and then people like, well, you know,
5 I'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,
6 and even if it's not environmentally safe, who cares, you know.
7 I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.
8 Uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for, just in my life.
9 And if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject, that you, one might care to bring up.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 But, it is comforting to me to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that cost us money.
3 Especially when we have dwindling, uh, resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf, and, and so forth.
4 Just, just every little bit does,
5 it makes me feel better.
6 It, it makes me feel like, well, there may be something left for my children, my nieces and nephews and so forth.
7 Well, yeah, uh.
8 Well, uh, wouldn't,
9 it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's, that's right, because,
2 Of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say, uh, coming from where you are in Texas.
3 Uh, no,
4 no,
5 because if, we,
6 what was it, seventy-four when we had the, the last last oil crisis?
7 And, uh, we started getting smart
8 and, and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And as soon as the oil prices came back down, we, the pendulum swang the other way.
2 Right.
3 And we need those reminders.
4 Yeah.
5 Uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, Oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.
6 Right.
7 Well, my dad's in the, in the solar energy business,
8 so, uh, You know, we're acutely aware of a lot of this.
1 What's your favorite T V show?
2 Oh. You know, I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE.
3 Uh-huh.
4 That's one of my old favorites.
5 Um, and that's,
6 I'm being beeped,
7 so I'll just ignore it.
8 Um, and now, I, I did like THIRTY SOMETHING
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 oh, yes,
2 my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH.
3 We like that one.
4 Yeah,
5 that's one of my favorites.
6 Good,
7 and how old are you?
8 I'm twenty-eight.
9 Oh, so you're little bit younger than I am,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 but yeah,
2 I think if my seventeen year old, my fourteen year old, my other two children like it,
3 I'm over forty,
4 and I like it.
5 I think it's wonderful.
6 Yeah,
7 it's a good show.
8 I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN, too.
9 Oh, yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 now see, I, we are so busy with, all of our kids are in sports,
2 and I hardly ever watch T V,
3 but that's one that, that we watch.
4 And then Sunday nights we watch, uh, LIFE GOES ON.
5 Yeah,
6 I like that,
7 that's, that's a good show, too.
8 Very good.
9 Did you see the one on Sunday?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 it was a, uh, uh
3 I did miss that Sunday,
4 no
5 I didn't.
6 That one kid that Becca likes he has AIDS.
7 Yeah,
8 it's a good episode.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 the, the new character on there did.
2 Right,
3 right.
4 All the way to North Carolina.
5 What time is it there?
6 Uh, it is twenty minutes to nine.
7 Oh, my gosh.
8 See, I'm twenty minutes to six here
9 Three hours difference.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yeah,
2 yeah.
3 Okay.
4 What else do you like?
5 Uh, let's see, I like a lot of different shows.
6 Let's see, um, I like MURDER, SHE WROTE.
7 That's, that's,
8 Oh, I never, I never watched that ever in my entire life.
9 And MATLOCK is another good one I watch.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Uh-huh.
2 Um, then during daytimes I like, I like ALL MY CHILDREN.
3 A small bowl will be plenty.
4 Oh, that's mine.
5 That's the only one I watch whenever I, oh,
6 a small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening.
7 Talk to my daughter.
8 Um, um,
9 ALL MY CHILDREN,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I've watched that for about twelve years.
2 Yeah,
3 I've, I'm sure I watched it for more than that probably.
4 Twenty something.
5 I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I,
6 I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.
7 Oh.
8 So that was a long time ago.
9 I used to watch it, was in high school and college when Laura's mother got killed.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 She was my favorite character on there.
3 I just,
4 I read the reason she got, they, they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract,
5 and I said, well, if they're going to do that to her, I won't watch it.
6 Oh, that's great.
7 Well, I do like ALL MY CHILDREN,
8 and I, and I like it, you know, I don't know.
9 I just,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I like the people on it, I guess, you know.
2 I, I, I like it.
3 I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back.
4 Yeah,
5 well, Tad's going to come back, I bet, do you think?
6 Yeah,
7 I'm sure he will.
8 He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.
9 I kind of wish that, uh, Nina would come back because she because the story, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 just for a brief visit or whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying, and everything,
3 Yeah,
4 like Daisy, pops in once in a while,
5 and, I forgot about Nina and Cliff, right.
6 Yeah,
7 Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now.
8 Oh, he is.
9 So he's out for good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 he's out for good.
3 Did they marry?
4 Uh
5 Nina and Cliff?
6 that's how they left the show, but not in real life.
7 Um.
8 Now she's married to some guy in New York,
9 and she's happily married
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and that's the reason she left the show.
2 I guess she wanted a private life.
3 Oh, okay,
4 oh, see I, I, I watch it maybe twice a month,
5 so, I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies.
6 Oh, well, I, I watch.
7 Because I play lots of tennis
8 and I'm gone a lot,
9 so, I don't get to watch,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I watch it everyday, religiously.
2 I videotape it when I have to miss it.
3 Oh, no kidding.
4 Yeah.
5 I use to be, I used to be like that
6 I'm that way about a lot of different shows.
7 I'm that way about MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN.
8 Now isn't DESIGNING WOMEN, don't they have a new chick on there instead of the, instead of what's her name?
9 Uh, yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 there's two new characters on there.
2 There's, um, uh, Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE.
3 I don't know if you know her or not.
4 Huh-uh.
5 That's a show I like.
6 And then, and then, uh, uh, the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART.
7 Oh, yeah, oh.
8 I don't like her on it,
9 I never have liked her,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so.
2 Well, I, I just know which one she is.
3 I don't, you know.
4 She's taken the Suzanne's part,
5 and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part.
6 Charlene was Delta Burke?
7 Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed.
8 Oh, okay,
9 well, see, I never watch that one either.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I really don't watch a whole lot of T V, just, you know, on Sunday nights,
2 LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner,
3 and my whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night you know, because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day,
4 Yeah.
5 and so we, we sit around and eat popcorn
6 and, oh, then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.
7 Those are always pretty cute.
8 Well, MURDER, SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that,
9 and so,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Oh, so you don't watch that one instead of,
2 Yeah
3 I I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different networks,
4 but BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH, I, I watch it religiously.
5 Sure.
6 Yeah,
7 we like that real well.
1 Okay
2 wow, I don't know what that was.
3 What was that?
4 I don't know
5 And, uh, to, uh, the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Oh, yes.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 uh, we have not camped in any of those places,
2 in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,
3 but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, uh, Daingerfield
4 and in Texas that is where we camp basically. Uh,
5 What are they like?
6 They are very nice.
7 Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.
8 It has a nice little lake
9 and it has some really wonderful, uh, sights that are in the wooded areas.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh, the facilities are quite nice
2 and our children liked, liked it quite well.
3 and you know they,
4 we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.
5 And, uh, it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh, now Daingerfield is,
8 let's see,
9 I think that's a little bit more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No,
2 I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.
3 At any rate it was, it was very nice as well.
4 But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.
5 Uh-huh.
6 But, uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, uh, had done a lot of camping in Michigan,
7 I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially,
8 and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,
9 so, uh, my parents were real avid campers
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.
2 So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally
3 Yeah.
4 Do you have a large tent
5 or,
6 Yeah,
7 it was a nine by twelve.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 And how many does it sleep, uh, comfortably?
2 Well, there, well supposedly,
3 they always say it sleeps more than it does.
4 Right
5 But they,
6 it would have slept three adults anyway.
7 Yeah,
8 Yeah.
9 Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, uh, we invested in some stacking, uh, cots, you know, that were like bunk, bunk beds,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but they were cots, fold up cots.
2 That really gave us a lot more space, um, floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around
3 and,
4 Right.
5 uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day
6 so that was real nice.
7 But, uh, we, uh,
8 like, my in-laws also had a camper, or, uh, a pop up tent, you know, one of those trailer tops
9 and those are really nice too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 A little more, uh, luxurious, so to speak, but not much
2 do they have a kitchen in them?
3 Yes,
4 uh-huh.
5 It's really nice,
6 in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, uh, and the whole business.
7 It was quite nice in that respect.
8 Uh, and everything was very convenient
9 and you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Trunk  of your car all time, right.
2 and that was nice.
3 So, uh, do you have plans for, for any other camping trips in the near future?
4 Uh, maybe, uh, maybe back to Caddo, or, Uh, Purdis Creek.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Right.
7 Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,
8 it's a new park.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 And there is, uh, not really camping,
2 but, uh,
3 what is it called, Cedar Hill.
4 Right.
5 Lake Joe Pool.
6 Oh, yes.
7 And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.
8 Yes,
9 yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I have been in that area.
2 That is a really pretty state park.
3 Uh, just,
4 we did not camp there,
5 but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area
6 and it's real lovely.
7 It's close to the lake and close to,
8 I think it's close to the dam up there
9 so it's, it's really quite pretty.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, are you, um,
2 let's see what was,
3 I was going to ask you something else.
4 Oh, do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?
5 Oh, from those three,
6 just, just, uh, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best.
7 Yeah,
8 uh-huh.
9 Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yeah,
2 that's right.
3 I, I would,
4 I have never been there
5 and I would love to see what it looks like
6 It's not, it's not very deep.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And they did build a dam on it,
9 but it was there before they built the dam.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It has been there for a hundred years.
2 Oh, I see.
3 Apparently, an earth quake caused it.
4 How interesting.
5 Yeah.
6 I guess I never heard the history of that.
7 Huh, well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go.
8 We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.
9 Um, our children are both grown
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 and, and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.
2 And so, uh, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see what it looks like.
3 Yeah,
4 it's really nice.
5 Yeah,
6 yeah.
7 And I, I don't know,
8 probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere  in Texas.
9 Is it?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh, yeah,
2 I think so.
3 Especially with, uh, uh,
4 when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,
5 Right.
6 especially in East Texas, it's really nice.
7 So, uh, well, I, um, I have enjoyed talking with you.
1 Okay,
2 well, do you have a pet?
3 I have two cats. And do, and, oh, and two fish.
4 Two cats,
5 you're lucky.
6 Your two fish.
7 And what do you have?
8 Well, my husband,
9 you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Oh, no.
2 My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.
3 So we have a black Labrador.
4 Ooh.
5 Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador,
6 but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the ranch, in the farm
7 and,
8 Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room
9 and then he goes out for the day.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But this, this is a beautiful dog
2 and he is wonderful with our little girls
3 and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line
4 and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.
5 Right.
6 Right.
7 And this is huge.
8 You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,
9 he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but he does.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah.
4 And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now was when he was, uh, about eight months old
5 Uh-huh.
6 and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one,
7 and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.
8 And I came home
9 and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, my word.
2 And it was in the floor
3 and I just about lost it
4 and I called
5 and I said, come home and get your dog.
6 And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me you know,
7 Oh, dear.
8 and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum.
9 He kept picking at it
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I didn't
2 the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
3 So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.
4 And I told my husband,
5 I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,
6 and he looked at me like, well, you know
7 Good-bye
8 He loves this dog
9 and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and he's a good dog,
2 so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to
3 and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.
4 I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet
5 But, I, I grew up with cats
6 and I'm very comfortable,
7 I love my cats.
8 Yeah.
9 I had one cat for eighteen years.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I got her when I lived in Hawaii.
2 Oh.
3 Before I even got married I had my cat.
4 She's old.
5 Well, she, I had to have her put to sleep last June.
6 Isn't she?
7 Oh, I started to say
8 then you broke your heart.
9 Oh, it was awful,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it was just awful.
2 Oh.
3 But, and she just sat there on my lap, you know.
4 Oh.
5 She just, just waited
6 and,
7 Bless your heart.
8 Oh, it was awful.
9 That makes me feel so bad.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But her hair,
2 but the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's shoes.
3 Yeah.
4 Oh, no
5 You know, and she just liked his shoes
6 and he'd have these dress hundred dollar shoes.
7 Oh.
8 Oh, no
9 Oh, it was just bad.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 And my closet
2 and it was, oh, something.
3 Oh, that's awful,
4 I never heard of that before.
5 Oh, it was terrible.
6 And once she did it, you know, then she would, I mean, she wouldn't,
7 if our shoes sat side by side, she would pee in my husband's shoes.
8 Uh-huh.
9 She must have known he didn't like her or something.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Or the smell or something.
2 Oh, anyway, I, I,
3 and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors, and would uh, clean the carpets
4 and
5 Uh-huh.
6 oh, dear, it was just awful.
7 Well, now, does your cat sleep in the house?
8 That was very funny.
9 They are, they are house cats.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, uh, well, I have two cats right now.
2 Yeah.
3 And, of course.
4 Oh, yeah,
5 good.
6 They sleep with my kids.
7 My kids, my, my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat.
8 Oh.
9 But the cat doesn't destruct does it?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 See, it doesn't do anything.
2 Oh, no, I I'm not going to have a dog.
3 See.
4 We've had two dogs
5 and, uh, they both got ran over. After we had them for several years, just nice little outside dogs
6 Oh, no.
7 but
8 Yeah.
9 were just my kids' friends,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 they would go they would go with me when I would go running
2 and and the last one got hit, uh, as she was following my, one of my sons across the road to the school.
3 Oh.
4 Oh, no.
5 It was awful.
6 It was just,
7 Oh, that is.
8 And it just, it's too heartbreaking
9 but they do dig up
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 and they just, they just wreck things
2 and I'm not a dog person.
3 They do wreck things.
4 Well, I'm not either.
5 Ooh.
6 I'm not either
7 and it's just been,
8 I wouldn't want a Lab.
9 It sounds beautiful,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but,
2 He's beautiful
3 but it's just one of those concessions, I just had to make,
4 but I kind of ignore him.
5 Now today's the first cold we've had in Texas
6 and it's really cold and drizzly
7 and it's freezing
8 Um.
9 and people are doing their fires
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there
2 and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square
3 and he's just huddled up like, if you'll be nice to me, I won't make any trouble, you know.
4 And then my daughters both have hamsters.
5 Oh.
6 And I, I,
7 And how old are your girls?
8 They're eleven and eight
9 and I gave in at Christmas
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 and they have, they keep their cages real clean.
3 It always smells of cedar
4 and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and,
5 Sure.
6 I think they're cutting us off.
7 No,
8 that's
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 somebody's trying to cut in on my line
2 and I don't want to answer.
3 f
4 I'll just wait.
5 Okay.
6 No,
7 I've, I've got incoming calls
8 and I don't know why, calling.
9 Oh, okay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I hate to cut it off,
2 I think they would cut us off,
3 I understand.
4 so we'll just wait.
5 Okay,
6 well
7 Whoever it is will call back.
8 they'll cut us off pretty soon.
9 Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 jeez.
2 Yeah,
3 I know.
4 Actually, it's my son,
5 I know it is.
1 Okay Brian.
2 Hi,
3 how you doing Kevin?
4 Fine, thanks
5 Good,
6 good,
7 glad to hear that.
8 I understand,
9 Are you a total banner?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Total banner?
2 Yeah.
3 No,
4 I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids
5 and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.
6 I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.
7 Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
8 and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,
9 so on a scale of one to ten, I, I think I would rate myself as a, in the six or seven or eight.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay.
2 But, I think that there ought to be some control,
3 but I still think that, uh, individuals have a right.
4 How do you feel about it?
5 Well, so, let me make sure,
6 so you think that, uh, maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate?
7 Well, I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate.
8 Uh, that, uh, that might cool down some tempers.
9 I think a, a one day would be sufficient.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows
2 and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun, if that five day waiting period were in effect, you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show.
3 Uh, you just, you would be able to buy it,
4 but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose, huh.
5 Well, I don't think you can mail thing, guns through the mail.
6 I don't know.
7 Oh.
8 Okay.
9 I think that's a, against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah?
2 So, how do you feel about guns?
3 Let's see,
4 I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns
5 and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault
6 Uh-huh.
7 whether, you know,
8 Well, do you think that there will continue to always be crazies?
9 Sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Then, uh, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns?
2 Well, we have some laws on the books that, uh, don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns, if I understand correctly.
3 And, uh, I would agree,
4 a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,
5 but uh, I think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a, a bit on the extreme side.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.
9 Okay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Do you, uh, do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a, an automatic handgun?
2 The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.
3 or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,
4 but, uh,
5 Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,
6 but, the public, I don't know.
7 I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Not a automatic, semiautomatic.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 not an Uzi
3 No,
4 no.
5 Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.
6 Uh-huh.
7 You saw Indiana Jones,
8 the guy came after him with that big knife.
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 And just, he took care of it,
2 just one shot.
3 Yes,
4 that's true,
5 and he, uh, saved himself in the, in the, in the process also.
6 That's right.
7 So how is work going?
8 Very fine,
9 very,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 They don't let you take guns to work, do they?
2 No,
3 they, That's, uh, that's prohibited where we work.
4 Although down here in Texas, uh you do have a right to, to wear and carry arms with you at all times.
5 Uh-huh.
6 That's still that's still, you can still do that down here.
1 So what movies have you seen lately?
2 Well, I saw, um, lately I've seen SOAP DISH.
3 Oh.
4 Which was a,
5 and that was a lot of fun.
6 It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things.
7 Well, see that's something I want to see,
8 Yeah.
9 that's on my list to see.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 it was, it was okay.
3 It was not, um, not a wonderful film
4 but it was, I mean it was, it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen.
5 Oh, okay.
6 I saw THELMA AND LOUISE. A couple of days ago, and really liked that.
7 Oh, did you?
8 Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 See that's also on my list.
2 And it's very, it's really disturbing but a good movie.
3 A disturbing movie,
4 how do you mean?
5 Well, it was,
6 um, let's see.
7 The, um,
8 it's, it's different,
9 it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, you know, shoot 'em up kind of film.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Right.
2 But it's with women in it instead of men
3 so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing.
4 A switcheroo, huh?
5 And it made me think a lot about, you know,
6 you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this
7 but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it.
8 Right.
9 When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, that was kind of interesting.
2 I've,
3 but I really enjoyed it.
4 Oh.
5 So, I
6 Because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school
7 and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble
8 Yeah,
9 that's kind of what it was.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 but,
2 Right.
3 um, yeah.
4 They had started out with that,
5 then they got into lots of trouble.
6 Before we found the shopping malls that's what we did.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah,
9 well, I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on my list then.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah.
2 I also saw that Madonna movie.
3 Oh.
4 It's TRUTH OR DARE
5 and that was pretty scandalous.
6 Scandalous?
7 Yeah,
8 it was kind of,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Madonna she's pretty trashy.
2 I can imagine.
3 And so it was, it was interesting
4 I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is, huh?
5 well, I think she kept saying that, uh,
6 they talked about her,
7 it, it was a film of her concert, um, tour she had taken through all, all around the world.
8 And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome,
9 and she, kept saying that her show was not garbage.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Huh.
2 It had a social message to it
3 and,
4 You just had to find it.
5 You had to wade through it and find it
6 Right.
7 We never quite believed that,
8 so.
9 You never quite got to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I thought that was pushing it a little bit
2 but, she ,
3 All I know about that woman is that she's an incredible marketeer
4 She is.
5 She's rich
6 Yeah,
7 and she's rich
8 and she,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so.
2 she's smart at what she does.
3 She knows how to do that.
4 She knows how to twist this around, huh?
5 Yeah.
6 What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it?
7 Well, okay,
8 see, we're getting back to last year.
9 That's probably the last movie I saw. Um, DANCES WITH WOLVES,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I just adored it.
2 Really?
3 How can I tell you.
4 Um, a couple years ago, I guess, well, maybe ten years ago I, I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE
5 and, so, you know, just the general theme of the whole movie was, um, pretty,
6 Uh-huh.
7 I mean I really liked it a lot.
8 Right.
9 I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood, you know, about the American pop, Indian population,
2 Right.
3 and then everything went away for a couple years,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and now it's back again.
6 And, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, um, what happened way back then.
7 Right.
8 Of course, no one will ever know.
9 Really I don't
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I know,
2 I was,
3 I wondered if, uh, the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be.
4 Well, who knows.
5 I mean it, it, it sort of showed like two different types of tribes
6 like one was a warring tribe,
7 and the other one was, uh, vegetarian kind of, you know, feel good tribe. You know, sort of thing,
8 Right
9 so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Nobody can get along peacefully
3 Yeah,
4 but I wonder
5 I thought
6 because they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the, the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe
7 and that, you know, that was so wonderful that they done that
8 and they, uh, uh, I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film,
9 Oh, I see.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 if it,
2 you know, you didn't, hear any press about that.
3 Yeah.
4 Huh.
5 I thought it was a very interesting movie.
6 Well, I think so.
7 I, um, I have come to respect a little bit more the, uh, you know, what went on here,
8 Right.
9 but, but who knows how it's supposed to all end
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh
2 Right.
3 You know on the, on the broad scope I mean, um, like if, uh, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I
4 meaning to me
5 I think about, you know, just the meaning of, um, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant.
6 Right.
7 And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms. And sort of trampling that
8 Uh-huh.
9 and, uh, so you know it, it meant something bigger I think.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But still it was a
2 I loved the buffalo scene.
3 And I thought Kevin Costner was just,
4 I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every, three minutes,
5 I know the
6 but he's the director, you know.
7 Um, but, yeah,
8 I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.
9 Well, that's good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.
2 That was, that was, it was, it was good.
3 I looked at my watch only a few times, which is a good thing.
4 Yeah.
5 Ate a lot of popcorn.
6 But it put me in a really, it put me in a really bad mood,
7 I don't know why.
8 Did it really?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 we
2 there were three of us who went.
3 We were just all really grouchy when it was over.
4 Huh.
5 So we decided that may be the mark of a good film.
6 It made us think.
7 And so,
8 It made you think.
9 we were grouchy.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 We felt guilty for being,
2 Maybe well, maybe that was, um,
3 but there are no answers, you know.
4 I know
5 and we, we had nothing to do with it.
6 That, that can make you crabby, yes.
7 We were not responsible,
8 but we still felt the thick blame for, what had gone on.
9 Really,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's true.
2 We could have,
3 But it, it's,
4 they sort of candy coated the western story for many years,
5 Right.
6 and, um, you know, when the truth, oh, well,
7 it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story
8 Uh-huh.
9 but,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Yeah.
2 Well,
3 I do.
4 I'm just out of school
5 so I've seen, a lot of
6 Oh, okay.
7 don't have a job
8 so I shouldn't go see movies all the time.
9 Oh, there you go
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, I rented a good movie, um, called CINEMA PARADESO which is an Italian movie which is probably the best movie I've seen ever.
2 Oh.
3 Oh.
4 It was just, wonderful.
5 Really?
6 It's, uh, story about a little boy in a Italian, a little Italian village,
7 and he, um, owns a, um,
8 or he works in a, a movie theater and it it helps the projectionist.
9 There's a little, oh, an old man who's the projectionist
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and he befriends this old man,
2 and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years.
3 Oh.
4 And it's just,
5 I mean, if you don't mind reading subtitles,
6 I thought I had to kind of get beyond that.
7 Those little, you know,
8 reading the little words at the bottom of the screen
9 but, um, oh, I just laughed and cried
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, I really loved it.
2 Oh, I'll have to write that down.
3 That was a, a great one.
4 Wow.
5 And other than that I,
6 I'll have to write that,
7 have you, have, did you see TEXASVILLE?
8 Are you into, Larry McMurtry?
9 No, I I hadn't.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I had read, um, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW
2 and but that's out on video now
3 and I haven't seen it.
1 Go ahead.
2 Okay,
3 do I still still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world?
4 Absolutely.
5 And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers, what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.
6 Um. Okay.
7 I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,
8 but I think just the instability of the country right now is,  sort of scary.
9 Well, that's what  makes it a powder keg.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 The, um,
2 I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,  when  my first real involvement with the military started.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Um, naturally we were at the time,
5 the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.
6 So we got lots, quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.
7 Uh-huh.
8 I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. And with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.
9 These weren't, these weren't Chinese made copies.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty-sevens. As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.
2 Um, uh-huh.
3 In Granada, in October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.
4 Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,
5 but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.
6 The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on Point Salinas.
7 And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.
8 Huh.
9 And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 In eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.
2 Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.
3 And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.
4 Do I consider them a threat?
5 Absolutely.
6 They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.
7 About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.
8 Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.
9 And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Huh.
2 I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.
3 These guys are top of the line.
4 When they, when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.
5 And they are very, very good at what they do.
6 So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet military, of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.
9 That
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.
2 Yeah.
3 I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.
4 Well, it's interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.
7 So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
8 There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.
9 If uprisings happen in their sectors, it is, it's going to be a total blood bath.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 it looks like it's come close to that as it is.
3 Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.
4 They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out
5 and they, would level entire areas.
6 Okay,
7 you're from the Dallas area, right?
8 Uh-huh.
9 Okay,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around Richardson?
2 Yeah.
3 You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area
4 and there won't be anything left alive.
5 And they can do that in about four minutes.
6 Huh.
7 And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.
8 They used them in Afghanistan, did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.
9 But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.
2 The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.
3 They drink that much fuel.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Were you,
6 have you,
7 I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?
8 No,
9 I haven't.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,
2 I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.
3 Uh-huh.
4 But,  during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?
5 Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?
6 You mean in the, in the most recent conflict?
7 In any of them since eighty-one.
8 Oh. Yeah,
9 definitely.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.
2 Yeah,
3 I think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.
4 It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.
5 It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,
6 it's a matter of money,  to  a certain extent.
7 Um.
8 Uh-huh.
9 The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.
3 Uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.
4 They're not really that worried about invading north.
5 They're more interested in,
6 they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that. From Mexico all the way down into Central and South America.
7 The situation down there is weird
8 and it's very screwed up.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Inflation is out of this world
2 and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.
3 And generally the people,  are  getting screwed,
4 and they're tired of it,
5 and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.
6 Yeah.
7 Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about to do something to get out of communism.
8 I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.
9 I think Gorbachev has about had his day.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.
2 That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.
3 Yeah.
4 Gorbachev has made his attempt
5 and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.
8 So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,  at  this point.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 True
2 I don't know,
3 I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.
4 You mean,
5 I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,
1 Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on?
2 I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East.
3 I have to agree with you there.
4 I, uh, I think that, uh, for once, we should, we shouldn't even be at, at these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, we really don't have too much of a, uh, real we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is.
5 Just let these people fight it out
6 I agree.
7 you know, we've got so many domestic problems,
8 and, and what does it cost these people over there, you know.
9 Absolutely.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Oh, so how about the Soviet Union.
2 What do you think's going to happen there.
3 The break ups?
4 I think that's great.
5 Um, I'm glad to see that,
6 but I, again, I don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, uh, well, uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because I, I don't know,
7 I'm, I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,
8 and so, I'm, I'm not much in favor of it,
9 but I'm glad to see us advising them
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.
3 That's right,
4 that's right.
5 But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,
6 even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody who, who is working on that problem.
7 And I, I haven't seen that in the last eleven years,
8 so they don't seem to have a clue.
9 Well, all I've seen.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of, of, of his political affairs.
2 I, I think Bush's kind of followed suit.
3 Um, international is important,
4 but, uh, we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.
5 Uh, you know, and then there's the homeless issue,
6 and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, uh, hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think,
7 and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending.
8 Oh, I agree.
9 I just, I think we got, once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the, the world bank, and as far as aid is concerned,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Right.
2 and I think there's a limit,
3 and we passed it a long time ago.
4 I agree.
5 We've been writing off way too many bad debts
6 Yeah.
7 That's another thing I don't understand is, is, is things like selling technology and, uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
8 to me that just doesn't make any sense,
9 as, as much in debt as we are
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I know it.
2 I just, I don't know.
3 I think it's definitely time for a change,
4 but I don't see anybody,
5 I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and Republicans,
6 and it's either one way or the other,
7 this it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society,
8 Right.
9 you either do it this way
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 or you do it that way,
2 and there's no in between
3 That's right,
4 you're either liberal or you're conservative,
5 and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.
6 Well, I think, uh, it wouldn't hurt,
7 and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a, a, a real force in, in the, uh, in Congress,
8 but, uh, you're right,
9 there's just too many issues that come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, uh, we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.
3 Oh, I agree with you.
4 Well, of course, you know, we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms,
5 and, uh, as soon as, as we can get,
6 of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him
7 so, it's not too, it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions.
8 He's, uh, usually on the ninety-eight to two side,
9 he's the one of the two that votes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 He's one of the two, huh.
2 Yeah,
3 he's, very ineffective, I think.
1 Hello.
2 Hello
3 Hi, um,
4 this is Betty
5 and I'm in Richardson, Texas.
6 I'm Nola
7 and I'm in Plano.
8 Oh, okay,
9 well here we go
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are, that did some stuff over in the Gulf. Um.
2 Yeah,
3 now, did you push one?
4 Yeah, uh,
5 Oh, okay.
6 no
7 I haven't pushed one yet.
8 I just,
9 Okay,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 but, I think it's,
2 I just started doing this
3 so I don't know too much about it.
4 Okay,
5 we're just sort of getting acquainted here.
6 Oh, okay.
7 Um, you know, I, I just wanted to see if, you know, you had an opinion about this,
8 or, you know.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, so, if that's okay with you, then I'll just press one.
2 That will be fine.
3 Okay
4 Well, hi,
5 Hi.
6 Good morning. Um,
7 I think I mean, if, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are,
8 and I mean they think differently
9 and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And, and right now, I, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just,
2 well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there,
3 I think we should just leave them alone.
4 I really do. In, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself.
5 Yeah.
6 And that's the way, the course that they should go,
7 I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,
8 but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.
9 The, the thing with Israel and Palestine, I believe that should be settled between them.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And also, um, you know, the other thing is their idea, or our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them.
2 I mean, I mean, I'm talking about the whole middle
3 and, and maybe this is too general,
4 but I just believe that, um, they do not look at democracy the same way we do.
5 They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live.
6 Yeah.
7 And, so, you know, trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just, you know,
8 I don't think that that's the way to go in this
9 and, um, you know, it, it. Oh, well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 I, I guess, you know, I'd like you to maybe express something here.
3 Well I, I, I think overall that's right.
4 I think it's kind of sad though, that, for generations they've been taught to hate each other.
5 Yeah.
6 And that's, you know,
7 if,
8 somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way.
9 That's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah.
2 You know, an, an, I, I think that, um,
3 true we do have completely different ways of looking at things, at a lot of things,
4 but, uh, at the same time, I think there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do, as far as example
5 and, and, uh, I think some different things could come from what's happened, than what we expect.
6 Well,
7 well, yeah,
8 um, I, I guess we could be a catalyst for their change.
9 I, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there
2 and I don't think we'd be talking about this, you know, the Israeli situation, Palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a war.
3 I mean that was one thing, that came out of it, good or bad,
4 Yeah.
5 I, I don't judge any war as good or bad,
6 it's just a war.
7 Yeah.
8 And I don't see any winners or losers,
9 I just see dead bodies.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm sorry. You know,
2 but, um, I, I just think, you know, you're right
3 and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along.
4 It's not going to be that we're going to, uh, you know, sort of, tell them to go to their room
5 and that's going to solve the whole problem.
6 Yeah.
7 It's going to be them,
8 But, that's the type of thing they understand.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 They don't understand any other way.
2 And, you know,
3 And so at that, at that, you have to work at their level, to an extent, too.
4 It's,
5 Yeah,
6 that, that's true too,
7 I, um.
8 They wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war.
9 Oh, well yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 they, they understand violence.
2 There was nothing else.
3 Yeah.
4 They love violent leaders, to, you know,
5 I mean look at, you know, the leader they had.
6 They, they just adored him, because he was so strict and cruel,
7 Yeah.
8 and, you know, for a while there he had them,
9 I can't figure out why they adored him.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Well it has a lot to do with their religion.
2 I got to say, that over there, um,
3 Yes,
4 yeah.
5 and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this,
6 because I, I've, you know, traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that
7 and one, one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life, um, is from that area of the country
8 and I mean he is just overly, he, he is abounding in kindness, let's say.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 And his wife is so godly, I mean, every thought,
2 they have a totally different life than we have.
3 Huh.
4 You know, and when you add the, um, commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them.
5 Yeah.
6 And they have very basic life, um,
7 well it's just a very basic life
8 and they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And it's, you know, everything is to the glory of Allah,
2 and, and, you know, and, it, it's almost like,
3 What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power,
4 Yeah,
5 well that's, see using that,
6 yeah.
7 yes,
8 and they abuse that.
9 And it's always been military
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and it's always been,
2 and that's, that's always been the way of the world. Don't you think
3 Which I think that that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are.
4 Yeah.
5 So it's really hard,  when you see the leaders, compared to the people.
6 But I think in a, in a way the war,  uh, I think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing.
7 And there are a lot of people who are good people.
8 Yeah,
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know, there's,
2 and I, I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying to get out of that situation.
3 Right
4 and surrendering,
5 that was,
6 Yeah.
7 And, and, the, you know,
8 it just really comes down to people are people, you know,
1 Okay,
2 we're supposed to talk about vacations.
3 Right,
4 so, uh, well, uh, what kind of vacations do you like?
5 Well, uh, I haven't been to many places,
6 but I have a opportunity to go to, uh, Paris, France, uh, with, uh, with my friend in April.
7 She is, her, uh, her family, you know, lives there,
8 and she's only been there once.
9 Her grandmother lives there
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 so I'm hoping to I'm praying I get to go. Uh,
3 Oh, that's great.
4 Yeah,
5 it's, it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Have you ever been to, uh, like New Mexico?
8 Uh, no, actually.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Why,  have you?
2 I was curious.
3 I was just wondering what it was like.
4 Oh, okay
5 No, uh,
6 I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and, uh,
7 Tahiti?
8 Yeah.
9 Tahiti,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 oh.
2 No,
3 no,
4 Haiti.
5 Oh, Haiti.
6 Right.
7 Where is that?
8 It's, uh, well, it's in the Caribbean
9 and it's the western half of an island,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Um.
6 So, yeah,
7 that turned out to be a really good experience for me.
8 So, what did you do when you were in Europe?
9 Uh, well, see, I went there when I was in high school, actually
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.
3 What did you do on the farm?
4 Uh, uh, uh, well, not that much
5 Just, uh,
6 Are you just  kind of sight, just kind of, uh,
7 Right,
8 I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything
9 But I, you know, drove a tractor, helped them weed beets and that sort of thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Um.
2 And, uh, yep,
3 and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home
4 and that was pretty interesting.
5 And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were, uh, staying for their vacation in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, like right across from England.
6 Um.
7 Uh, so, uh, where in France are you,
8 Paris.
9 Right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Paris.
2 Yeah.
3 And, uh, um, how long do you plan to be going for?
4 Uh, two weeks.
5 Last time she stayed two months,
6 but we're only going to stay two weeks.
7 Uh-huh.
8 So,
9 Great.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, uh,
2 We're going to take a cooking class there,
3 so that might be fun.
4 A what?
5 Cooking class, you know,
6 French cooking.
7 Oh, great.
8 Yeah.
9 And, uh, what else are you planning to do, if anything?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Museums, you know,
2 go to museums and,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah, um,
5 Do you go to museums in Europe?
6 Uh, actually, no,
7 I don't think I went to any of them.
8 Uh, the closest thing I did was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That, there is some on that west coast of France
2 and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany.
3 Um, that's neat.
4 Yeah,
5 that was nice.
6 Uh, um, but, so, uh,
7 Hey,
8 what about,
9 have you ever been to Hawaii?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh, no,
2 I haven't.
3 No?
1 Hello.
2 I pressed the button one,
3 so we're recording right now.
4 I'm sorry
5 That's okay.
6 I'm Bill from Raleigh.
7 Okay,
8 and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.
9 Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Um, okay,
3 Bill, we're talking about family reunions.
4 Right.
5 Okay, um,
6 have you ever had to plan a family reunion?
7 Uh, yes
8 and no,
9 it wasn't really a a planning one,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but it was kind of, uh, it was a birthday
2 Oh.
3 and I brought a lot of family together then.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And how did you feel it went?
6 It went pretty good.
7 I'm, I've worked in hotels,
8 so I, I kind of know how to do these things.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 I used to, you know.
2 All this planning and, and getting together and such.
3 Um, oh, let's see what else.
4 Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,
5 and and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family.
6 Uh-huh.
7 She has like seven sisters I think.
8 Oh, boy
9 They show up and all their kids.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And then all, she has, uh,
2 I have like, uh,
3 let's see,
4 she has four sons and two daughters,
5 and they show up and all their kids,
6 Uh-huh.
7 so it's a pretty big reunion,
8 it's about two hundred people, maybe.
9 Oh, my word.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?
2 Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.
5 Oh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks
8 and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, that's good.
2 And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.
3 Uh-huh,
4 and then did you have a main meal,
5 or did everyone just bring,
6 it  was just pot luck.
7 It was kind of  pot luck.
8 Uh-huh.
9 You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 yeah,
3 show off a little bit
4 Yeah.
5 And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook.
6 Oh.
7 Oh.
8 Now how old is she?
9 Uh, she's eighty-six.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, goodness.
2 Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.
3 Now she does,
4 she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
5 Oh, wow.
6 and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
7 Uh-huh.
8 Oh.
9 Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Oh, yeah.
3 My nickname for her is Honey Woman.
4 That's what I call her.
5 Really.
6 Well that sounds fun.
7 Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,
8 and there were,
9 we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 And so that was a real challenge,
2 and I was president of our family reunion for two years,
3 and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,
4 but I found that advance planning was the key to success.
5 Uh, also one thing that's helpful,
6 and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
7 Uh-huh.
8 but most of, all my family lives like in the same county
9 so
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Oh, that's wonderful, though
2 But it's just kind of like get on the telephone
3 and, it's so and such days from such and such date
4 Oh.
5 and everybody just shows up.
6 Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.
7 Yeah,
8 our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,
9 I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I would say you're spread out, then.
2 We are
3 Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,
4 because my dad was in the Army
5 and we're we're pretty strung out all over.
6 Oh.
7 But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.
8 In.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I live in Raleigh,
2 and then my, my parents live in Greenville,
3 and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville.
4 Uh-huh.
5 So I mean, we're, we're spread out,
6 but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro
7 Boy.
8 so.
1 Okay, um,
2 I have two children
3 and they're older now,
4 but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and,  um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home
7 and that's what I looked for
8 and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,
9 and that worked.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, that's good.
2 Yeah,
3 that worked out real well
4 but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,  and  be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important ,  that they  do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,
5 Uh-huh.
6 Yes,
7 yeah.
8 Uh-huh.
9 so
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but I had,
2 I have switched schools several times because I, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.
3 I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.
4 Yeah,
5 I, um,
6 that, that's,
7 oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids.
8 Yeah,
9 for the for the kids.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yes.
3 well, I'm just recently married.
4 Uh-huh.
5 So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon
6 Okay.
7 but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh,
8 I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children,  are  under four,  or  five.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Wonderful.
2 Yeah,
3 I'm a college professor,
4 Oh,
5 so,
6 great.
7 and that's also,
8 and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,  and  then one or two evenings,  so  that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Great.
2 Oh that's, wonderful.
3 Yeah,
4 so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,
5 Yeah.
6 I  think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,
7 That's wonderful.
8 I can  even teach on Saturdays and,  and  things, like that.
9 Oh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 great,
2 Yeah,
3 um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care,
4 Right.
5 and  one of the things they made in, um, uh,
6 real
7 they're number one priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home *transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their"
8 Oh, that's,  wonderful  too,
9 So,  they, um, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,
2 Uh-huh.
3 so,  she is
4 I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it.
5 So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess
6 and even though she took off two years for, um,
7 I guess four years all together,
8 Uh-huh.
9 it  would be three years,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 how old's Kayla
2 three, yeah,
3 I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old,
4 and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,
5 Uh-huh.
6 so I guess she took off three all together
7 and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home.
8 Oh, that's wonderful.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think they were really lucky there,
2 but I think they've lost this woman she she will not continue.
3 Oh, dear.
4 And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.
5 Sure,
6 yeah.
7 So I don't know what they are going to do.
8 Oh, you know that's an ideal situation,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but  not many people can afford,  something like,
2 Yeah,
3 I think,  I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're, um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is,
4 Uh-huh.
5 so  she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,
6 Uh-huh.
7 so  she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a,   in a practice almost. Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years
8 Sure.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty twenty-six
2 so by that time she was so well established, you know,  I  guess it made it a lot easier.
3 Right.
4 Sure.
5 but,  uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,  if you have that,  that professional occupation where you can change.
6 Oh, I do to.
7 Oh, yeah,
8 Yeah.
9 but  they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh,  lucky,  uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yeah.
2 That's right,
3 that's true, yeah.
4 uh, because I'm a single  parent,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and  I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce, um, when the children were small
7 and so I, uh, was a teacher
8 I, uh, still am teacher,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and  it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted,  where  I could,  have piece  of mind and when I taught school * transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace"
2 Yep.
3 Yeah,
4 and I knew my kids were being taken,  care of.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,  I  just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and,  that's it .
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that,
2 yeah,
3 that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and  sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.
6 Right.
7 They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C
8 and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want
9 Sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and  I,
2 it's a very important part of your life
3 and I hope to read with my kids,
4 but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four,  or  three,
5 Well.
6 I agree with that.
7 you know, I can  see that when you make that point.
8 Well, the thing is,  I  teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other,  children
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically,  because  they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in their way, *to should be too
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yep,
5 uh-huh.
6 and so  I want my
7 I wanted my children
8 and they did learn to get, to get along with other people.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's a really important point.
2 Yeah,
3 and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults
4 and I bet if we trace back to their,  early  childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with,  people.
5 Yep.
6 I think that's really, that's important
7 I, I've seen the same thing
8 I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone
9 or
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 before I was married I went out with a girl,
2 and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And I bet,
5 and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old,  and  never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful.
6 Uh-huh.
7 I bet you could trace all the way back
8 I bet you could too,  because  it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and  if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or,  successful adults I  should say,
3 That's true,
4 yeah.
5 Uh-huh.
6 you  know, really
7 but, uh, it is a big problem
8 and you I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children
9 and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Uh-huh.
2 or  they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.
3 Yep,
4 that's true.
5 Yeah,
6 that's really true.
7 So you need,
8 cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,
9 and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,  your  wife gets to stay home,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah.
3 I  would have, have given anything if I would have been able,  to  stay home with my children.
4 Yeah,
5 I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky.
6 Yeah,
7 you.
8 Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I teach a computer classes
2 so,  it's, it's  one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor
3 Oh, great.
4 and I'm also, um, you know,
5 they have vocational type courses on weekends,  almost  everywhere,
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 and,  you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday,  which means,  that, you know, whole week's worth of courses
9 Oh, that's,  wonderful.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so that lets you be available three days during the week,  you know,
2 Oh, great.
3 so you be will home with your kids I you know
4 it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,  wanting  to spend more time with my children,  because my dad  had very, um, nine to five type job,  with,  uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home,
5 Um.   You're very wise.
6 Uh-huh.
7 so, by the time he got home he was so tired
8 and he was all rung out from the day,
9 Sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and  I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing.
2 Sure.
3 You know, my mother
4 I, I came from a family, that my mother stayed home until we started school.
5 Uh-huh.  thirteen  and a sixteen year old.
6 Um, and I, I don't, uh,
7 It's probably costing you a fortune.
8 Oh it is,
9 they  really are expensive,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 yeah.
2 My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.
3 Exactly.
4 um,
5 Well, and they
6 most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.
7 Oh.
8 So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so  that you know an older, older, older, truck
2 so I can afford it,
3 Yeah.
4 but,  you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car,  drove in  carpools all over the place
5 Carpools, uh,
6 and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere,  something like  that.
7 Yeah,
8 my parents did a lot of that.
9 That's right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yep.
2 And just to save you trips to and from,  you know,  uh, ball games and athletic events,  and  activities at the school.
3 Right,
4 exactly.
5 Right.
6 That's right.
7 Yeah,
8 isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care
9 and it lasts along time. *along a long
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 It, does for ever.
2 It, it lasts a long time.
3 And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren,
4 so
5 It's not ending is it
6 You think we've talked a long, a long enough time?
7 Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this.
8 Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.
9 Well, you don't have to
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 but they,  they,
2 Uh-huh.
3 um, you go the length
4 and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes.
5 Oh.
6 Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.
7 I see.
8 Uh-huh.
9 I see.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Are you from the,
3 where are you from?
1 Okay.
2 All right.
3 What's your view.
4 Huh?
5 What's your view?
6 Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally.
7 Yeah
8 Yeah,
9 that's true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean,
2 You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, you know,
3 That's right.
4 That's right.
5 I don't know.
6 Coming from Texas you're probably,
7 I don't know
8 I shouldn't make stereo types,
9 but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 It is,
3 but I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas,
4 I just live down here now.
5 I've  I've lived down here a couple years.
6 Oh, you're  just live down there?
7 Yeah.
8 I'm originally from Colorado,
9 but  yeah
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh well.
2 there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.
3 Yeah,
4 well I know how you feel.
5 I'm, uh, I grew up in Nebraska
6 and, and we always use to go out and hunt all the time, you know
7 and man, there's no way. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons.
8 Uh-huh.
9 That's just,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I don't know.
2 I just think, I think it's ridiculous.
3 Yeah.
4 I mean,
5 It doesn't sit with me very well.
6 I don't know, I, anymore
7 I keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.
8 Really.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I just about all,
2 well I live in Minneapolis
3 and I,
4 well actually I live in Florida,
5 but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year
6 and you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
7 Uh-huh.
8 Right.
9 and it's just, you never know who is out there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 You know it's just for self protection purposes
3 and then of course there's the hunting issue,
4 so
5 Sure.
6 yeah
7 that's good.
8 What do you do, Jeff?
9 Uh, I, I'm in, uh, program control for a company up here.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Oh, yeah.
2 Yeah.
3 All right.
4 We do schedules, for programs, schedule programs.
5 Yeah.
6 What do you do?
7 I'm, uh, researcher of Honeywell up here.
8 Oh, okay.
9 So, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah.
2 You guys uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
3 or,
4 Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.
5 I don't own a shotgun,
6 but I'd like to go bird hunting.
7 Yeah.
8 You know  that's something I miss quite a bit.
9 So.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yeah,
2 uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you, you know, quite a bit
3 Yeah.
4 but,
5 Yeah.
6 All right.
7 Yeah,
8 my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit,
9 but I don't know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, uh, for a complete,
2 One for a total ban and, uh,
3 That's right.
4 I guess I am about eight or nine
5 Yeah,
6 I, I agree with you there
7 Yeah,
8 no doubt about it
9 but, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't
2 Yeah.
3 I, you know,  I'm not  for it.
4 Yeah,
5 if there's  if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know that
6 they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun
7 Uh-huh.
8 and then they actually, uh,
9 I know it's this way in Florida.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They have a waiting period where you buy one
2 and that's a week
3 Uh-huh.
4 and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.
5 I think that's a pretty good idea.
6 Uh, and that's,
7 I don't know,
8 that's not a bad idea,
9 but then again you can always get around that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You could go through the black market like you say.
2 You know, you always be able to get around
3 but, uh,
4 Sure.
5 Yeah,
6 it's one of things
7 but, uh, I don't know.
8 I guess, I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't either
2 Yeah,
3 I'm just not,
4 I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned altogether anyway.
5 Yeah,
6 I
7 There,
8 fully auto,
9 but, even well, I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It kind of takes the sport out of hunting
2 Yeah.
3 Right.
4 You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.
5 Sure.
6 You know, you might do the same thing.
7 Right.
8 And so it's like, I don't know. It does.
9 It takes the sport out of it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 For me I would much rather have a bow anytime
2 Oh, really.
3 I, I like bows.
4 You know, I have done some bow hunting
5 and I, uh, I get into it
6 and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.
7 Yeah.
8 But, uh, I don't know.
9 I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Sure.
2 But, uh, I don't know.
3 Anyway, that's about where I stand
4 Me too.
5 You, uh,
6 Yeah,
7 I am about the same way.
8 And you, uh, have you eaten yet or whatever.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Is it seven o'clock there?
2 Uh, yeah,
3 it's about seven fifteen.
4 You guys central?
5 How is the weather up there?
6 Oh, it's not too good.
7 It's kind of rainy actually.
8 Is it?
9 Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 and it's been up around forty.
3 So people are, people are whining about the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature.
4 Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that
5 so.
6 Yeah.
7 I am just up here for the year
8 and it's kind of shocking.
1 Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets  there at your home?
2 Yeah, I do.
3 And what kind do you have?
4 I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.
5 I live alone in an apartment,  and, uh,  except for the cat.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh
8 How about you?
9 Well, we have a cat, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?
4 Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature
5 Uh-huh.
6 and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,
7 so  he's an indoor cat,
8 Uh-huh.
9 so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 How about yours?
2 Well, yeah,
3 he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.
4 Huh.
5 He's, uh, been so mean to her
6 And, and you say you've had him how long?
7 We've had him for about two years
8 Two years.
9 and he was so mean to her, um, right after we first got him.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So we had him neutered, and, and declawed,
2 and now he bites her.
3 He can't scratch her any more,
4 Huh.
5 he bites her.
6 Does he bite her enough to draw blood?
7 Yeah,
8 yeah,
9 he has a couple of times,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But he's a very possessive cat.
4 He, he loves my son,
5 it's his cat,
6 and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
7 Yeah.
8 and he's so funny,
9 he just follows my son around just like a dog.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Huh.
2 He won't even let my son shower.
3 Yeah.
4 He meows and wants to get in the bathroom
5 and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.
6 So he's quite a animal
7 Yeah,
8 boy,
9 I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.
2 Yeah.
3 You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.
4 Yeah,
5 well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,
6 Uh-huh.
7 Sure.
8 but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,
9 and we do keep our daughter away from him.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah.
4 Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house
5 Is that the only pet that you have?
6 It is,
7 uh-huh.
8 We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.
9 Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, we gave him up and tried.
2 Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,
3 Yes,
4 uh-huh,
5 we're in a house,
6 but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,
7 I see.
8 we couldn't allow him to run free,
9 so, he was just chained up all the time,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and it was,  it was  unfortunate.
2 Sure.
3 So have you tried any other pets?
4 No,
5 no.
6 I, I live alone in an apartment,
7 and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh
8 Oh
9 although I've heard rabbits are pretty good
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Oh.
2 you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Oh, my word.
5 and they apparently, uh,
6 especially when they're young when they bring them in
7 Oh, my word.
8 uh,
9 And do they, they just paper train it or something?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I guess.
2 I guess,
3 yeah,
4 and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either.
5 Yeah.
6 Well, rabbits are darling.
7 That would be fun if you could get them trained.
8 Otherwise they're pretty smelly
9 Yep,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's right.
2 Oh.
3 Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, uh,
4 Huh-uh,
5 we don't have C, we don't have cable.
6 I see.
7 Well they have, uh, uh, a they call it the Westminster Dog Show, uh,
8 I think it's in New York City at the, at the Gardens
9 there once a year live
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 and they had that on last week,
3 and that's really  kind of something  to watch, uh,
4 Oh.
5 it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
6 Is that right?
7 and some of the weirdest animals you ever  want to see in there.
8 Oh
9 Some of them are really beautiful, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 So.
3 Well, I'd be, interesting to watch.
4 So you live in Utah do you?
5 Yes,

3 and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
4 Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts
5 and, uh, I've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and, all that kind of stuff.
6 Oh like typing noises in
7 And I enjoy it,
8 it's relaxing.
9 And you kind of get absorbed in it
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on.
2 And I play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else's ears
3 because I'm not that good at it,
4 but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while.
5 Oh really?
6 How about yourself?
7 Well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz,

9 so I never have time to deal with them.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Really?
2 I like photography a lot,
3 Oh, yeah,
4 that's neat.

9 Oh, that's great,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 uh-huh.
2 first one, you know how that is.
3 And, um, uh, I play the guitar and a banjo.
4 I mainly play the guitar a lot,
5 I play about every night.
6 And, um, I really love that,
7 if I had a druther ,
8 if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something,
9 because that's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I've,
2 Oh, that sounds nice.
3 I like bluegrass, too.
4 yeah,
5 I've done it before and when I was in in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and it's really a, a blast.
8 My wife hates it,
9 but that's the way life is, I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 That's the hard part, right?
2 Exactly.
3 If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
4 yeah,
5 we, uh,
6 she's, uh, into aerobics,
7 and, uh, and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
8 Oh, that's good, too.
9 and that went over real well,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 but, uh, that's about it there.
3 Oh, it's good
4 and it's healthy, too.
5 Oh, yeah,
6 yeah.
7 We do that too,

2 Yeah.
3 That's great.
4 And we like movies,

3 we have, uh,
4 we're looking for a baby-sitter
5 so we've been out twice in in this year so far. By ourselves without the child
6 Uh-huh.
7 so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say.
8 Sure.
9 Um, hobbies,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things, um,
2 Oh yeah,

4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah,
6 we did some remodeling when we bought a house,
7 we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering,
8 that's fun.
9 It's really kind of fun.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It is.
2 It really is.
3 Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,
4 yeah.
5 Yeah,
6 exactly.
7 I like things that, you know, two people can do,
8 but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know,
9 kind of gives you some space for yourself,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create,
2 and I like to crochet and knit.
3 I made some afghans and that kind of stuff.
4 I like doing things with my hands.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Sounds like it.
7 Yeah.
8 Do you like to cook?
9 Yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I love to cook.

3 I love to cook, too,
4 I'm, uh,
5 Italian food
6 Oh, really?
7 Yeah,
8 pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff.
9 Well, we're all skinny farts
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so, I,

4 I like to cook and eat and, to have, mainly, I guess, I get to
5 Yeah.
6 amount of people eat, *listen and then say, man this is really good,
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah,
9 it is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 um, um, but it just,
2 work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
3 Do you do barbecues?
4 Yes,
5 we sure do,
6 smoke them
7 Well, uh, uh, smoking and  all that stuff?
8 Oh, yeah,
9 all that hoedown stuff.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yeah,
2 yep,
3 All that stuff that's bad for you.
4 I, I lived in Abilene for  a little while, and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant,
5 Oh, sure,
6 yeah.
7 and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue,
8 and, uh, oh, that was great.
9 Oh, yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really great,
2 That's, uh, only way to do it.
3 they have some nice stuff down there.
4 I miss it
5 Well, yeah,
6 it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh,
7 there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,
8 Oh, yeah.
9 but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I like the sports,
2 I play a lot of racquetball.
3 We did, I did horseback riding, too,
4 in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses
5 and, uh, that was kind of for them,
6 but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know,
7 so, uh, that was a real,
8 I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,
9 we always had horses around,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and I really enjoyed that,
2 Oh, that's great,
3 sounds like you,
4 and I was disappointed when I went to Texas.
5 I didn't see that many of them.
6 Horses?
7 Yes
8 Yeah,
9 you really don't.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 the,
3 you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh,
4 I know,
5 I know,
6 it's true.
7 there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people
8 and that's about it down here,
9 and so,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah.
3 But, uh, that's great.
4 Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.
5 Yeah,
6 you too,
7 you too.
1 So, do you fish?
2 Oh, yeah.
3 My dad has a lake cabin,
4 and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.
5 It takes us about three hours to get there.
6 And we go, and we fish,
7 and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,
8 but it's fun.
9 Uh, from a boat or from shore?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 From the dock, from shore.
2 Oh, that's nice.
3 Uh, mostly catfish
4 or,
5 Oh, mostly we catch carp.
6 If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.
7 And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.
8 But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.
9 What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.
2 Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,
3 so we don't ever catch enough to eat.
4 Carp is usually pretty much fun.
5 Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.
6 And that, that's a pretty good fight.
7 So that's a lot of fun.
8 Yeah.
9 A real light line, real light rig?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah.
2 Well, that sounds like fun.
3 They fight hard.
4 Fish in Colorado different than that.
5 Yeah?
6 Mostly trout in the mountains.
7 Yeah,
8 and in the rivers and stuff?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 mountain streams and rivers.
3 Are they good to eat?
4 Uh, yeah,
5 very. Yeah, very much there, you know.
6 Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?
7 Um, by and large, no.
8 But, but they're big fun.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I've been,
2 is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that
3 or,
4 What?
5 Are you fly fishing
6 or are you using a bobber?
7 I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I cast a ways.
2 I'm not highly proficient,
3 but it's fun.
4 I've never even tried that.
5 My,
6 if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble
7 Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.
8 You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You're casting the weight of the line.
2 With the little thing on the end.
3 Yeah,
4 well,  the fly on the end weighs nothing.
5 Yeah,
6 I thought it had a weight.
7 It weighs less than the line.
8 Oh.
9 So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And  you whip the line.
3 Um.
4 As you whip it, over your head,  or  side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?
7 Well, no,
8 no.
9 You fish upstream.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, you fish upstream?
2 Right.
3 And then you let it carry it downstream.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And then you reel it in,
6 and you do it again.
7 You hope that they think it's a bug and,  and eat  it.
8 Yeah,
9 exactly.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 exactly.
3 Yeah.
4 Jump at it.
5 Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
6 That's a fish?
7 No,
8 no.
9 It, it looks like a grub.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yeah.
2 Oh, it's a, it's a lure.
3 Okay,
4 whenever you, yeah,
5 a lure, a fly.
6 I see.
7 Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else
8 Uh-huh.
9 and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me. Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Um.
5 Uh,
6 Did someone just come up with this design,
7 and, and you're going to make one for yourself,
8 Uh,
9 or  are you going to buy it?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 You can buy them.
2 Uh, I've got some.
3 And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year,
6 huh?
7 Yeah,
8 yeah.
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know how that changes, the phase of the moon
2 and,
3 I guess so.
4 We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures,
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 I, I, You see, I'm from west Texas.
8 but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.
9 Oh, are you?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah.
2 Where are you from?
3 Lubbock.
4 Oh, I'm from Midland.
5 Oh, another west Texan.
6 I went to college at Tech,
7 so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.
8 Yeah,
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah.
2 I've been up there.
3 It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.
4 I didn't catch anything,
5 but I've been up there
6 Yeah,
7 it's fun.
8 It's lazy.
9 Take a picnic lunch.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I used to do that with my dad.
2 Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot.
3 Yeah.
4 Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 we do most of our fishing at night.
8 Yeah.
9 Just from the heat of it all.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.
2 It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.
3 It does?
4 I've only been up there once.
5 In the summer. Well,
6 no,
7 I've been up there twice in the summer.
8 But both times it was really pleasant.
9 In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 June?
2 We were in Mesa Verde Park,
3 and it was like the end of It was just before July fourth.
4 Oh.
5 And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.
6 We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better
7 And here it went and it froze,
8 and it snowed on us.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 We did not know what to do about it.
2 Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.
3 It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,  hearing  the crickets, and listening to the birds and,  seeing  the squirrels and,  camping  out, and eating out,  of  doors
4 Yeah.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Do,
7 Yeah.
8 and,
9 Do you have to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 do you wear waders when you fish?
2 Uh, I probably ought to.
3 I just freeze.
4 Oh.
5 Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.
6 Yeah,
7 yeah,
8 well, you know,  ankle deep or standing on  the bank, and slipping it out there.
9 That's cold water around there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um. Do you have any,
2 You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,  out there,
3 Oh, I see.
4 and  you know how it is.
5 The water's kind of,
6 Yeah.
7 And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,
8 and you move a little closer.
9 And then you're in to it just a little bit,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and then you splash in
2 and,  the  next thing you know, your knees are wet.
3 Yeah.
4 Do you have any kids that you take fishing?
5 Uh, got a stepdaughter.
6 Uh-huh.
7 She's real sweet.
8 And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 A fuzzy little dog.
2 I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.
3 Oh.
4 And the little one, of course, is, could care less.
5 Yeah.
6 The,  uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,
7 we got him a little pole last year,
8 and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up
9 That was what he considered fishing
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 This year, he's gotten to where he can.
2 We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,
3 and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.
4 Yeah.
5 And he started trying to cast it.
6 So, he, he was kind of getting there
7 but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now
8 Yeah,
9 you guys sure want to be out of range.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.
2 It takes time.
3 Yeah.
4 Yeah.
5 Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?
6 Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.
7 And we still had a good time out,  of  the deal.
8 Yeah.
9 Well, that's good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.
2 Oh, yeah.
3 My husband would like to live there,
4 but I don't know. All of our family is here
5 so,
6 Well, and you've got to have,
7 you've got to work for a living.
8 Well, yeah,
9 but T I is up there,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 so that part of it would probably work out
2 What division you all in?
3 I'm sorry, what?
4 What division are you all in?
5 We're both, uh,
6 I was, uh, military,
7 but he's division three.
8 It goes back and forth.
9 Division, well,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 maybe division one right now.
2 He's in computers.
3 Oh.
4 So,
5 Well, the only thing up here,  is division one.
6 And he's in school,  and everything else.
7 I have some friends who work up there.
8 Oh, yeah?
9 Kathy and Kevin Guy.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Okay.
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah.
4 And they like to fish.
5 They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.
6 Her dad has a cabin,
7 and they go fishing, up there.
8 Oh, fishing's,  fishing is fun up here.
9 So that would be neat to,  try it some time.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 It's  not,
2 It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.
3 But it is fun.
4 Yeah,
5 You know,  The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.
6 long as  you have a good time, that's the main point
7 so,
8 Uh-huh.
9 You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Definitely more to look at.
2 And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,
3 Yeah.
4 Yeah.
5 The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.
6 We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.
7 And we figured we were up a long way off.
8 And then it rained that night,
9 and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And we got up the next day,
2 and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away
3 And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.
4 So, that was kind of funny.
5 Yeah,
6 it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.
7 Yeah,
8 I just love the way it looks.
9 I could almost just watch the
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,
2 and if you were there. I mean,
3 it was,
4 one time we were there,
5 and I guess it was late May,
6 so it was really your spring almost,  you  know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here.
7 Uh-huh.
1 Well a lot of women are as knowledge about football as I am.
2 Can I guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the Steelers.
3 Yes,
4 uh-huh.
5 Well, I can understand that.
6 I, you know, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.
7 Do you?
8 They've had  some great games in the past.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I always enjoy watching the the, Dallas and Pittsburgh together. You know.
2 Uh-huh,
3 me too.
4 It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.
5 He lives in the Dallas area now, as a matter of fact.
6 Does he really?
7 Well, actually, it's probably closer to Fort Worth,
8 but it's, it's in the same area.
9 He bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 But he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often.
3 As a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.
4 Oh,
5 I wonder if he'd ever do that.
6 I don't know,
7 he'd be good at it.
8 He's such a motivator, he,  primarily,  you know, with the quarterbacks.
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Uh-huh.
2 That  would be his specialty.
3 I wished, I wished they could work something,
4 I really like him.
5 I really do.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Well what about the Houston Oilers.
8 Do you like them?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 okay,
2 I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl.
3 That would be really great.
4 Uh-huh.
5 That may not ever happen,
6 I don't know.
7 Uh, Houston  has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years
8 and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And Warren Moon,  is, is  proving himself quite well right now.
2 That's right.
3 He certainly is,
4 he's very good.
5 Uh-huh.
6 He's very good.
7 He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are.
8 That's right.
9 Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 but he's no longer with the team.
2 So, you're right,
3 there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.
4 Uh-huh.
5 How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year.
6 You have any idea.
7 I don't know,
8 I hope they, they do better.
9 They, they
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,   that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.
4 Yeah.
5 Oh, yeah,
6 that was just such super team.
7 Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.
8 Yeah.
9 Well that's a tough,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it would be tough to do,
2 it really would.
3 Uh-huh.
4 They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?
5 Yeah,
6 four in a row.
7 Four in a row.
8 I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.
9 Oh, I don't know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Shooting  for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.
3 That's right
4 And,
5 But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,
6 so.
7 That's right.
8 I think Mike Webster was left
9 but then he, he just left.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 yeah.
3 Uh.
4 He may have been the last of the old guard,
5 I don't know.
6 Yeah,
7 I think he is,
8 I think he was.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 they had such a super team.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
5 No,
6 I didn't.
7 I see.
8 Huh-uh.
9 There's quite a bit of activity now,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.
2 They picked up,  you  know, quite a few of the,
3 Uh.
4 of course you never know.
5 The guys they pick, you know, may never play a game.
6 You never know,
7 it's, it's a gamble,
8 it really is.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh-huh.
2 They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know,
3 Well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?
4 Ever been?
5 Uh-huh.
6 Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born
7 his name was Sam Huff.
8 He used to play for the New York Giants.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,  as  far as, you know, dedication.
2 Really.
3 He just went all out every single play.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,
6 there's been so many.
7 Yeah,
8 But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.
9 Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 well, I, I come from a large family
2 and, there's quite a few boys
3 so that's kind of how I got in with the football.
4 Either watch that or watch nothing.
5 That's right.
6 And, um, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I  thought he was kind of cocky or something.
2 He is,
3 he is,
4 Uh-huh.
5 of course a quarterback has a big ego.
6 Yeah,
7 uh-huh.
8 They really they have to have,
9 they can't survive.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 uh-huh.
3 They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you.
6 Yeah
7 him and Franco Harris,
8 I really didn't care for the either two of them.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh-huh,
2 I mean  they were good,
3 but, I, you know, you couldn't deny that.
4 Oh yeah.
5 But I  didn't, I thought, you know, well I just didn't really care for either one of them.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, Lambert, Ham,  and,  uh, Stallworth and Swan.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 absolutely,
3 I can't disagree with that.
4 They were super players,
5 they really were.
6 Uh-huh.
7 They really,
8 I, I, I like, not just with the Pittsburgh, I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the, the best plays from,  you  know, from the week or something.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Yeah,
2 highlights, yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 I love watching that.
5 Then I like watching their bloopers too, you know
6 Yeah,
7 yeah,
8 that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact
9 Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 well they make mistakes too, I guess.
3 Yeah,
4 uh-huh,
5 it's  funny that more people don't get hurt. You know, especially, I would say the receivers,  when they're in  the air and they get tackled.
6 Absolutely.
7 Uh-huh,
8 oh they,  They take such a beating.
9 Oh, yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.
2 Absolutely,
3 I don't know how they do it.
4 It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,
5 it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.
6 Yeah.
7 An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.
8 Oh, absolutely.
9 They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Gosh, what a beating,
2 they really do take a beating,
3 they really do.
4 Yeah.
5 Well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator.
6 I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think
7 I don't know,
8 I, I'm knowing what, you know,
9 of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I really am.
2 He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.
3 Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,
4 Uh-huh.
5 he  doesn't even look like he's in shape.
6 He's just so big, no one can move him.
7 That's right, yeah,
8 absolutely.
9 There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't know, you know,
2 I,
3 probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.
4 I, you know,
5 obviously not very fast.
6 Uh-huh.
7 But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way.
8 As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird.
9 I don't know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Dallas has a guy, uh, his name is Nate Newton,
2 now he has a real weight problem too.
3 He fights it every single year,
4 but, he manages to still keep playing,
5 but,  he  has a terrible weight problem.
6 Yeah.
7 Wow.
8 They
9 the coaches watch him all year long.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But I guess most every team has has someone like that,
4 I don't,
5 Oh, yeah,
6 there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.
7 Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.
8 Uh-huh.
9 I guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 you would, uh-huh.
3 Yeah.
4 Um, now who,
5 would you say that you have a
6 I mean other than Dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback.
7 I mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know.
8 Oh, yeah,
9 sure,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.
2 Yeah,
3 I I, I enjoy watching him play.
4 Yeah,
5 his age is about to catch up with him though.
6 He's no Spring chicken anymore.
7 No,
8 but he's still performing.
9 And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Warren Moon's an  excellent.
2 But he's very exciting to watch.
3 Yes he is,
4 Uh-huh,
5 sure.
6 I, I,  I enjoy watching him also.
7 Uh-huh,
8 absolutely.
9 What about, uh, Marino?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, I'm,
2 obviously he's a very good quarterback,
3 I'd, I never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know.
4 Yeah,
5 he may, uh-huh.
6 Yes
7 he was,
8 I believe that's right at one point in time.
9 but he's a very young fellow.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah,
3 of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.
4 That's true,
5 that's true.
6 If not, he gets  beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,
7 you
8 Dallas did better last year,
9 hopefully they'll do better this year.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 to someone else in the Uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh.
2 Yeah,
3 uh, I didn't, I don't know,
4 I, I just think, you know Marino will get better
5 and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,  you know,
6 That's right.
7 so.
8 Yeah,
9 Miami's had some down years, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Yeah.
2 But they all do, I guess,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah
5 That's true,
6 and with age comes,  you know,
7 Yeah,
8 with
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 the,  the
2 I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,  you know.
3 Oh yes,  very much so.
4 Hip injuries and things like that, yeah.
5 Right,
6 yeah.
7 Yeah,
8 that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they're so young,
2 That's right.
3 but, they're  retired, you know,
4 Uh-huh,
5 yeah,
6 I read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years.
7 So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.
8 Oh yeah,
9 but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.
2 Yeah,
3 a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.
4 that's
5 Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.
6 That's, that's a pretty short career on average.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.
2 Yeah.
3 Um, what do you think of the, uh, L A Raiders,
4 used to the, the Oakland?
5 Yeah,
6 they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws
7 and,  if  their, if their, you know, arrest record won't let won't let them play anywhere else, they seem to go to, they seem to go to the Raiders.
8 But  that just may be, you know, perceived,
9 you know perception,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay
2 Okay, uh,
3 the question was about, uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Well, uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should.
6 I try to walk.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, uh, last year I would, I did it every day,
9 but I've kind of, in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,
3 but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier.
4 I agree
5 But it's just to get motivated to do it,
6 and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I I do it every night.
7 Uh-huh.
8 It's just to get, uh, motivated again,
9 and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And I was walking,
2 and it got kind of dark.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And I was by myself,
5 and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.
6 Ooh.
7 And, so I, I kind of got frightened,
8 and I kind of use that as an excuse.
9 All I have to do, is start earlier,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but.
2 Right.
3 I haven't walked since,
4 so.
5 It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.
6 I know what you mean.
7 Yeah,
8 it sure is.
9 It sure is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 How about you?
2 Do you exercise on a regular basis?
3 Um, well, I try to.
4 Um, I started at the beginning of this year,
5 I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again,
6 I'm going to be real good,
7 and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, uh, aerobics classes there.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And they run for two months at a time.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 And you have to, you do have to pay to take them.
2 And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half,
3 so that was four and a half hours a week.
4 Oh.
5 And it cost sixty dollars,
6 and I thought, okay, that's not cheap,
7 that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.
8 Right.
9 And I had a friend of mine going,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so I was real good,
2 I only missed it about three times.
3 And then, oh, March came around,
4 and I signed up again,
5 and I got, uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I,
6 and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there.
9 And so that was two weeks I had missed,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.
2 Yeah,
3 it's once you get out of that habit you just don't, you don't get back into it.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Because I teach school,
6 and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.
7 We went in together and hired a private instructor,
8 and she came to our school twice a week.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 And, I, I was,
2 I would go faithfully,
3 and then I missed once.
4 Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I think, if you,
7 you just have to stick with it.
8 Oh, yeah.
9 I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 and this session is about to run out.
2 Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes
3 and some of them require me to go out of town,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, and, uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.
6 Yeah.
7 lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone
8 and I've found excuses, uh things like I had the flu last week,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 but I'm fine this week.
2 I could have gone Monday.
3 I could have gone tonight,
4 and I didn't.
5 Yeah.
6 So, I'm kind of finding excuses,
7 and now it's kind of like, well,
8 this is the last week.
9 I'll just start fresh next week.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 But, I better better do it.
2 And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.
3 She started taking tennis lessons,
4 and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.
5 Yeah.
6 So.
7 Sure,
8 yeah
9 that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 Like it's misery loves company.
3 I don't really love exercise.
4 I mean, some I,
5 the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,
6 and, uh, it's not President's any more.
7 I don't know what the name of it is anymore.
8 But she loves it.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her.
2 Uh-huh.
3 She just enjoys it so much.
4 And I don't.
5 Yeah.
6 I'm the same way.
7 I feel good after I do it,
8 but I hate it when I'm doing it.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know, I just,
2 I don't enjoy it at all,
3 and she just loves it.
4 So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, you know.
5 Uh-huh.
6 And, it's a daily thing for her.
7 So, it, you know,
8 and it's so hard for me.
9 I envy her,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I wish I could be that way,
2 but I don't. I don't,
3 I do too.
4 and I have an older sister that loves running, too,
5 and she runs all the time,
6 but at, to me, it's every minute's agony,
7 and I,
8 in fact, I don't run.
9 I hate to run.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something
3 and that helps, you know, pass the time.
4 Right.
5 Yeah,
6 walking is kind of boring.
7 I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,
8 and we try to, we used to try to get together,
9 and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 And it's not as boring if you get several people
5 That's right.
6 and you can kind of talk,
7 and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,
8 and the aerobics isn't too boring.
9 I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. Um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.
2 Yeah,
3 yeah.
4 But, uh, I do, I do have to make myself go,
5 and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,
6 and after I get finished I feel great.
7 Oh, it's great afterwards,
8 yeah.
9 I mean, I can go in there,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I can be,
2 like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,
3 and I'll have headache and everything,
4 and I get out,
5 I don't have a headache any more.
6 I feel great,
7 and I'm just,
8 it's amazing how much better I feel.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And then just in general, I sleep a lot better
2 Yeah,
3 that's right.
4 and I just feel much better.
5 I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,
6 and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better.
7 Exactly
8 it does,
9 it gives you energy.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.
2 Yeah.
3 Well, I'm too tired,
4 or I have a headache
5 or,
6 well, I just got over the flu,
7 and I'm still kind of draggy
8 so I better not go
9 It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 it really is.
3 Yeah,
4 I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,
5 and, you know, it's silly not to,
6 but, I don't know,
7 it's just a put off.
8 I don't know why I don't do more,
9 and I, and I know that it's good for my health.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I know, you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.
2 Right.
3 So, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.
4 So.
5 Right.
6 There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,
7 but I don't know.
8 It's just hard to make yourself go.
9 And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 and I've been sweaty,
2 and, and it, you know,
3 I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.
4 Yeah.
5 So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.
6 So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.
7 Yeah.
8 Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But, um, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in.
2 Yeah.
3 Does it cost the same for just two nights or,
4 No,
5 it's less expensive.
6 Well, that's good, too.
7 This one was only forty-five dollars.
8 But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 yeah.
2 Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go
3 That's right,
4 that's right.
5 So hopefully.
6 Yeah,
7 yeah,
8 it's right there,
9 and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They've got two different aerobics rooms,
2 they have the mirrors.
3 Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall
4 you don't like to see how you work.
5 But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.
6 But,
7 Yeah,
8 and then they hire private instructors?
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, that's great.
2 And they have ceiling fans in the rooms,
3 and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. Um,
4 and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.
5 I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.
6 Yeah.
7 And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I can see that would be, uh, easy.
2 They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.
3 Oh, yeah
4 Well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?
5 Quite a few do.
6 They have probably, ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,
7 and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. Uh,
8 they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter,
9 and I guess guys can take advantage of that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again.
2 Oh, yeah.
3 But there's a lot more guys that do that one.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,
6 they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that.
7 So they have big variety.
8 They even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.
9 I've never done that one before.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 But.
2 Oh, you have a pool there, too?
3 Uh-huh.
4 Oh, how nice.
5 They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.
6 They've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need just about.
7 Wow.
8 It's a real, it is a real nice facility.
9 It's also got a full inside basketball court,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things.
2 But it's, it is very nice.
3 That's great.
4 I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should.
5 Now to use,
6 I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.
7 But.
8 Well, does it cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to to go swimming.
9 Do you have to pay for that, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,
3 and it's about eight dollars a month.
4 Oh, that's not bad.
5 No,
6 not at all
7 Huh-uh.
8 Pretty cheap.
1 Well, uh, what what do you think about the metric system?
2 Uh, do you, uh, find it useable?
3 Have you tried much with it?
4 Well, with an engineering,  degree,  it's, of course, it's a whole lot easier.
5 Yeah.
6 Uh-huh.
7 because,  uh,
8 To use you mean,
9 uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 if, if somebody  is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human nature being what it is we don't like to change.
3 Yes.
4 Uh, it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal.
5 Yes.
6 And it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 We,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well I've lived both in the United States and, and in a country where they do use the metric system
2 and, uh, so I've, I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.
3 Um, the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and,  pounds  to uh, uh, kilograms,
4 Right.
5 That's right.
6 and, I  think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters,
7 Right.
8 how  on earth am I every going to do the math? *spelling
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or whatever, and, you know, and leaving it at that
2 and, uh, you know, a kilogram weighs about this much
3 and get used to it from scratch,
4 cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters
5 but I'm perfectly comfortable using either.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And I think the real problem with this, this weird conversion, you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, you know, whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour, you know,
8 people, you know,
9 it's hard to take it seriously.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 And as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,
3 you just say, well look read the miles per hour one,
4 the other one must be for someone else.
5 That's right.
6 Uh, I don't know,
7 I mean even Britain has converted over
8 and we inherited this mess from them
9 and, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 That's right,
2 it's all their fault.
3 Well, I mean, it's more  our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,
4 I don't know why they um, were more able than we were
5 except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now
6 and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to
7 Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,
8 is much more necessary for them than for us.
9 That's true,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's, that's probably true
2 and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.
3 There's an expression for that,
4 With eyes on the past, backing confidently into the future.
5 I've never heard that one,
6 that's very nice
7 Oh, so I'm all for the metric system and converting over
8 and I think,
9 I guess, my feeling is the way to do it is, is to just start giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound,
2 this is a package of dates mind you,
3 it's, was, presumably something you weigh fairly precisely,
4 it said one pound
5 and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams
6 Right,
7 right.
8 And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda
9 cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 every time I see something like that I think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument.
2 Yeah.
3 Well, uh, I, I don't think it'll, it could ever happen with, with a quick transition.
4 You don't?
5 No.
6 I, I think that would be the easiest way
7 but human nature being such as it is,  I would  think it would take, probably, two or three years before people could completely cut the cord.
8 Uh-huh,
9 uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 oh, oh, that's what I was thinking by quick transition,
3 I didn't mean, you know, I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,
4 at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.
5 Did they switch?
6 Uh, I believe so,
7 yeah,
8 and I think they did it overnight
9 cause you know, you can't do it gradually.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 That's an example of something you can't do gradually.
2 Well that's true.
3 It, it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
4 Yes,
5 it does
6 A quantum leap from left to right hand drive
7 Interesting.
8 And they,
9 but, you know, that must have taken, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that was something that had to be done quickly,  you know,  because of external circumstances,
2 Oh, yes.
3 but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe,  or  the rest of continental Europe
4 Yeah.
5 and, you know. But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.
6 Yeah.
7 I'm sure.
8 Um, so I, I, I, I, I think it's essential that it's done
9 and I think the real trick is to avoid the you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 a little more attention to human psychology
2 and, whereas, people want round numbers
3 and after all, the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers,  so they  don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch
4 Exactly,
5 exactly.
6 and so what the exact,
7 the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented.
8 Really, I think.
9 Well, we do have the two liter soda pop bottles.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 I saw that,
3 I saw that the other day.
4 I don't drink soda pop,
5 Yeah.
6 but  I saw a two liter soda pop bottle
7 so, yeah,
8 things like that are a good start
9 and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers,  you know,  two point two pounds or something. I think people will start getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Right.
2 Yes.
3 That's true.
1 Okay, Howard,
2 what do you think of our space budget
3 and should we go ahead and, and keep exploring,
4 or should we call a halt to it,
5 is it doing any good?
6 I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.
7 Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,
8 Uh-huh.
9 and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.
2 So I think it's been a good investment.
3 Uh, somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed  program.
4 Oh, really.
5 Oh, yes.
6 Wish our post office could do that
7 I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.
8 That's right.
9 I wish they'd just deliver stuff.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,
2 I think maybe  we can  pick up and go on now.
3 Uh-huh.
4 But, I, I don't know.
5 I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.
6 I agree.
7 The space  station's where we should go  at this  point.
8 I agree.
9 Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, you know, you know, and I'm in favor of, you know, getting closer to seeing certain things,
2 but I'd like to see them also go, you know, go back up there, see, you know, what they can do. See about setting a space station up.
3 I'm all in favor of the space program,
4 and I don't think we should stop,
5 and I don't think we should cut the money.
6 Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?
7 Uh.
8 You talking about, uh, uh, a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I would like, I'd like to see that.
2 I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.
3 But who knows.
4 And I would like to see them do something like that.
5 Well,
6 I,  I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things
7 and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.
8 Well, I think about half the nations now are, are military related, are they not?
9 Yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 yes.
2 And, uh, It seems like it's that high a percentage.
3 I believe they are.
4 You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our experiments and all the, you know, our actual exploring of space and, and all that,
5 and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.
6 Well, it can't afford to
7 Huh-uh, you know.
8 Have you gone out to, uh, Fort Worth to see the space, Soviet space exhibit?
9 No,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 we were talking about that this weekend.
2 We, it's only going to be there a couple of more  weeks.
3 Uh-huh,
4 uh-huh.
5 We need  to go.
6 We went, uh,
7 we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,
8 and it is marvelous.
9 I mean, it's really neat how they, they have done it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They have done a beautiful job.
2 Have they?
3 And they have a, uh, scaled down model showing how they, you know, fuel it, or, you know, how they, uh, oh, the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they, uh,
4 all the things that are against the actual space mission, uh, space ship, you know, how they fall away from it,
5 and the loading of it
6 Oh, yes.
7 and then it's actually, you know,
8 the smoke comes out like it's taking off.
9 It is really interesting.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.
2 You really do.
3 It's, it's well worth the time and effort.
4 We went, uh, early on Sunday.
5 We got out there about, uh, ten, ten thirty,
6 and the,
7 Now do  you have to have tickets ahead?
8 Excuse me.
9 No,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 we  bought tickets there,
2 and if you have children, if you go to McDonald's, you they have coupons, or did have.
3 Now they may be through with them now.
4 But, uh, buy one adult
5 and one child gets in free.
6 Um, I think both of my kids are too old for that
7 Oh, okay,
8 oh, okay.
9 they're both,  uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You have teenagers or something.
2 Yes,
3 yes.
4 Yes,
5 well I had grandchildren so, three of them, so between their mother and their grandfather and I,
6 because their dad was at work
7 and, uh, But, and the boys loved it, you know,
8 Did you,
9 they really did like it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It's very impressive, I'm sure.
2 Uh-huh,
3 it is,
4 and I felt the, uh, six year old would, you know, that he'd be kind of bored,
5 but he wasn't.
6 Even the three year old enjoyed it
7 because they had one, had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon, and showed it moving around and stuff.
1 In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.
2 Do you?
3 Why?
4 Why?
5 Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.
6 You think the problem is not enough doctors?
7 I think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your uh, I mean, on your liability.
8 Gosh, for one thing.
9 Oh?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 And you think there are plenty of doctors?
3 Oh, yeah,
4 I don't think there is a shortage of doctors
5 and I do know that O B, which is my field the doctors' health the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies.
6 Uh-huh.
7 It's astronomical.
8 Now they can't doing anything about that.
9 I don't think they're in a conspiracy.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.
2 No,
3 people don't sue
4 People are very sue, sue conscious.
5 lawyers sue.
6 If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
7 Yeah.
8 Well, that's probably true, too.
9 But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, sure.
2 And, so,
3 But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.
4 You know what tort theory is?
5 No.
6 Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.
7 Right.
8 Well, it, uh,
9 an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's right.
2 If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.
3 Well,
4 If, if they have complications and,
5 It depends.
6 Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,
7 but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.
8 Well, that's true,
9 they are because doctors are performing many more tests.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Many of them are unnecessary,
2 they are doing so many C sections just to prevent.
3 Just to prevent a a law suit.
4 Because they have all these monitors now
5 and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,
6 Yeah.
7 and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.
8 Yeah.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 See, I believe that there, there is a system already in place for health care.
2 So, it's terrible.
3 Uh-huh.
4 You know, they have indigent health care.
5 You show up at Parkland bleeding
6 You'll get it.
7 That's true.
8 In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And we have that happen.
2 We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic
3 Uh-huh.
4 and at the last minute, they come to us.
5 Well uh, we can't turn them away.
6 Uh-huh
7 So,
8 Yeah,
9 I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Yeah.
2 I'm for that.
3 I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,
4 so I'd like to wipe them all out
5 Yeah.
6 Well, I, I happen to know a few
7 and I even claim one as a friend.
8 He's a divorce attorney.
9 But,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 He better not be mine
2 I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.
3 But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.
4 Yeah,
5 some they do.
6 Uh, he just said,
7 They stop their O B at least.
8 Yeah,
9 I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Right,
2 Right.
3 His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.
4 That's incredible.
5 And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.
6 Yeah.
7 And most of them are very sincere.
8 Most of them do the best they can.
9 Yeah
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They are human.
2 Occasionally something will go wrong.
3 Well, you can be human and Catholic.
4 I know you can be human and Catholic,
5 but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.
6 Yeah,
7 no
8 I mean,
1 pretty good,
2 pretty good.
3 So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen
4 Drug testing in the work place.
5 Um. I've been tested a few times, just before drug employment.
6 But that's about it.
7 I've never had random drug testing.
8 Yeah,
9 we have random drug testing at, in my business,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but I've never been, uh, never had to do it.
2 Oh, really?
3 Yeah,
4 yeah,
5 they started that about a year ago,
6 and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
9 at least that's.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Oh, they do with alcohol.
2 Pardon?
3 They do it with alcohol?
4 Yeah,
5 yeah,
6 they, they, they'll check for alcohol.
7 Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
8 No,
9 once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Huh. That's interesting.
2 Yeah,
3 it's a,
4 What type of field of work are you in?
5 I'm in the oil business.
6 Oh, in the oil business.
7 Yeah.
8 Okay,
9 and you work in the office around.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah,
2 I work in the office,
3 so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah
6 see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 and we work around a lot of explosives.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.
2 Yeah,
3 so that's, you know,
4 I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,
5 and so they could blow up the whole,
6 well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,
7 but still, it can be dangerous.
8 Yeah,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 well, I, I, I agree.
2 I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.
3 Yeah.
4 You know,
5 if it's,
6 as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,
7 as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.
8 Now do they fire them, or do they?
9 Well, see, this is it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 this is where I start having my problems with my company.
2 I work for a private company,
3 and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.
7 Oh, wow.
8 So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.
9 Huh, that's.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I think our policy is that,
2 all right, it's probably the same thing.
3 I'm not really sure what the
4 Yeah,
5 really,
6 it's one of those things that you read once,
7 and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it
8 That's right.
9 But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 yeah,
5 our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
6 I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
9 Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
2 and, you know, it's not,
3 I guess I haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh, so I you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,
6 I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.
7 Uh-huh.
8 So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A and B are going to be in
9 and next week, C and D are going to come in
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 You could time it just right.
2 Yeah,
3 right,
4 right.
5 I know one employee,
6 I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,
7 and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
8 That'd be just as dangerous.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.
2 Huh. That's true.
3 You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case
4 Uh-huh.
5 Do they give any limits on alcohol,
6 or is it?
7 Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
8 I don't think they do.
9 Um, well, they must,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I mean, gee whiz.
1 So the general topic is hobbies.
2 Yes.
3 Let's hear about your hobbies.
4 Well, let's see,
5 what kind of hobbies do I have?
6 I guess, uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing.
7 I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports.
8 And, uh,
9 Any handicrafts?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Excuse me.
2 Any handicrafts?
3 No,
4 not, not really, um,
5 no,
6 I'm really not too creative
7 well, I, uh, you know, around with my hands and things like that
8 I leave that more up to my Mom
9 So, um, I think I'm in handicraft.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 I think it will become resume writing.
3 Oh, well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long.
4 Uh, yeah,
5 I, I hate to think about it
6 and, and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah,
9 it, it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking for the, uh, different shifts up there?
2 I
3 who knows.
4 Is it, uh,
5 basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,
6 No,
7 all means about fifteen to twenty percent,  of, of,  oh,
8 Oh, wow.
9 I'm sure the number's somewhere classified
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 but some of the internal news and the news services,
2 so, it's approximately six fifty,
3 Uh-huh.
4 so  ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five
5 and twenty percent would be one thirty.
6 Wow,
7 how about that.
8 Yeah,
9 that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 that's possible.
3 How about that.
4 Well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate
5 is there many other,
6 are you in the defense?
7 Oh, yes, .
8 Is it, uh, many other corporations in the area?
9 Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding
2 I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?
3 Yes.
4 That, uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.
5 Yeah, uh,
6 no,
7 Apple's coming to town
8 and,  and that  has some opportunities
9 Oh, really?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, uh, and,
2 Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs?
3 Colorado Springs specifically,
4 yes.
5 How about that.
6 And, uh, and, uh, M C I coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death
9 but,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing?
2 Uh, I'm a defense worker.
3 I'm, government tool control specialist.
4 Right,
5 yeah,
6 that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also.
7 Are you still employed?
8 Am I still employed by T I,
9 no,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I took a leave of, of T I back in November.
2 Oh.
3 Actually, December was my first month away from them.
4 Exempt or ?
5 Exempt.
6 Oh, yes.
7 It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.
8 It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave,
9 but it was just an opportunity arose
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and decided to take it.
2 Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package.
3 No.
4 I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there,
5 but it was just, I missed it by a couple months.
6 But, you know, what can one do.
7 I'm just happy still to have a job.
8 So, are you happy with what you are doing now?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I am kind of happy with it,
2 it's getting better all the time,
3 I knew it would be different from the very beginning,
4 but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system,
5 so I was in the computer operations
6 it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar
7 there's, you know, there's benefits
8 and there's things that weren't as good,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but  as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.
2 Good,
3 good.
4 Well, it hasn't been a long time T I
5 or I,  I'm  significantly shaken by the situation,  but  not devastated.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Right.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the the defense area but manufacturing in general.
2 To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.
3 Uh-huh.
4 That's great.
5 That's good.
6 And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time,  just,  just to know, what's, possibilities are,  you know,  what might happen.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Sure,
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table.
2 But still in all,  it feels funny.
3 It may be a blessing in disguise.
4 I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused
5 and they're just,
6 actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.
7 So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,  I  can't seem to get into it right now.
8 Exactly.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass ,
2 Uh, situational.
3 I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Well, would you like to be there?
6 I,
7 all things being equal, yes.
8 Uh-huh.
9 But, or, or even somewhere better,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Sure.
2 but,  God this is much better than west Texas.
3 Uh-huh
4 Well, just take the day,
5 But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.
6 Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.
7 I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.
8 Oh, that's a beautiful place.
9 Goes to U T.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 That's just fantastic down there.
3 Take it more as a,
4 this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,
5 pick out where you want to live,
6 and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.
7 I see that's the problem.
8 For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,  and  where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Sure.
3 And now I feel lost.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah,
6 that's a,
7 it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it.
8 Oh, I had job offers.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.
2 And that,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something
5 if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.
6 That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,
7 I'll take a chance,
8 if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.
9 Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Five years.
2 Yeah.
3 I've been with them sixteen.
4 Yeah,
5 I can imagine, you know, the longer and longer it goes,
6 Actually, seventeen now,
7 and, oh, yeah,
8 momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But so, yeah,
2 I'm looking as, as a opportunity.
3 Well, that's good,
4 you've got a good attitude about it.
5 And, and I'm looking at it as a change.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.
8 Right,
9 there you go.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's the way to do it.
2 And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.
1 Okay, uh,
2 my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE
3 and it has been for a long time
4 but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it.
5 Do you by any chance?
6 Oh, yes.
7 You do!
8 Yes,
9 very much.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, wouldn't you know
2 As a matter of fact, I prefer public television.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And, uh, I have, particularly enjoy the English comedies, and the English mysteries.
5 Yeah,
6 Yeah,
7 I watch mysteries too.
8 Is that what you're referring to?
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay,
2 yeah.
3 That is good.
4 I like, uh,
5 do you read?
6 Vociferously.
7 Okay,
8 well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books.
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 And, the plots are more, um, challenging, you know, than the sitcoms of regular T V.
2 Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the only access we have to that of course is public television.
3 Yeah.
4 I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect
5 but, uh, the watching,
6 what I do watch is, uh, usually news and whatever is on public television.
7 Any kind of,
8 I also uh, am very fond of great performances, in that regard.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 yeah.
2 Me too.
3 But, uh
4 Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF?
5 No
6 Oh, that was a scream.
7 no,
8 no
9 as a matter of fact, uh, Turner Broadcasting, has been uh, broadcasting all of the James Bond movies, every night this week,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 Really.
3 so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, this week
4 I used to like him too,
5 he was my hero.
6 In fact, I like Sean Connery to this day.
7 Well, they're showing uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,
8 Yeah.
9 and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Yeah.
2 So,
3 Oh, he can never cut it
4 No,
5 no
6 that's true.
7 I was just thinking that today, he did, well, in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate, in his early movies.
8 Yeah,
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 he does.
3 Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy look,
4 Uh-huh,
5 yeah.
6 I liked his accent too.
7 And, he can even be in movies that are not, uh, uh, sexually oriented,
8 and he still comes off great.
9 Well, you know he was, when was it, last year or year before last, he was voted the sexiest actor in movies, or something.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 He is.
2 Yeah,
3 he had my vote double
4 I mean the man is sixty-two years old.
5 I don't care
6 But, uh, but otherwise you know we,
7 uh, with P B S and so forth.
8 And I, I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but uh, the series, uh, YES MINISTER?
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Oh, what's that about?
2 That was about a, the Interior Minister,
3 it was a comedy,
4 Oh, yeah,
5 yeah.
6 the Interior Minister of, in England, with the permanent secretary, and bureaucracy and all that.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Right.
9 Right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I've seen it several times.
2 It's a scream,
3 but I have to go to bed,
4 I have to get up and, and work the next morning.
5 I wish they'd put those,
6 that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF.
7 It came on after DOCTOR WHO, on Saturday nights, here at least.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And it should,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 of course I
2 really it was,
3 I don't think they should show it during prime time,
4 but still, it was funny.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 I know.
8 Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher.
9 I, I read as I said, and, uh, quite a bit.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.
3 Yeah.
4 What, what do you do?
5 What kind of work do you do?
6 I'm a Payroll Clerk.
7 Just an accounting clerk.
8 At T I?
9 No, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I have a friend who works for T I
2 and I work for a tire service, here in,
3 Oh, I see.
4 I'm from Dallas.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I
7 and I just wondered.
8 Yeah,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it could be T I I think, probably are participating more than anybody else,
2 but I needed the money.
3 This is five bucks here.
4 I think that's something we all
5 Yeah,
6 really.
7 Do you work for T I?
8 No,
9 no,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I work for G T E. In Maryland,
2 Really?
3 yes.
4 How did you hear,
5 oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we?
6 I guess not.
7 How did I hear about it?
8 Well I work, you know,
9 they are gathering a data base for voice processing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And, that's my field of work also.
3 Oh!
4 So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this
5 and I heard about it,
6 so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, uh, You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth.
7 Oh.
8 Right.
9 We could go back to television shows.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Well, you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible?
2 Yes,
3 I have.
4 I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true.
5 Well, no.
6 That's, uh,
7 you could interpret it that way.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.
2 Yeah.
3 Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.
4 Right.
5 Okay,
6 so you can have,
7 there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing.
8 So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So that's, you know,
2 you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true,
3 but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.
4 Yeah.
5 So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.
6 Yeah.
7 You can look at it, you know,
8 if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.
9 I guess if you're looking for that, you're,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 well, Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.
3 that, uh,
4 Uh-huh.
5 So,
6 Really.
7 But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.
8 Yeah,
9 that's right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, so, uh.
1 Uh, Greg,
2 uh, I, I'm not familiar.
3 I think, uh, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?
4 Yeah,
5 we do have the death penalty here.
6 It's not exercised very often,
7 but we do have it.
8 Uh-huh.
9 I believe it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Uh-huh.
2 I know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,
3 but, uh seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that, that the person just, I feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in, in prison for life.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Right.
6 But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,
7 but just seems like in some cases that it's a, it's a good policy.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, I, I tend to agree with you,
2 uh, I've changed my views over, uh, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest.
3 Uh, uh, when I was in when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh,
6 you know, that
7 the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
8 Right.
9 But the, uh, the more,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 now I live in downtown Dallas,
2 and I, uh, you know, I've seen, uh, I've seen cases on, in the news and all where, where, you know, uh, a, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.
3 Right.
4 Right.
5 I think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder.
6 That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.
7 Yeah,
8 it seems sensible and failsafe.
9 I, I, uh, I don't,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 you know, not completely failsafe,
2 but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.
3 Right.
4 Uh I also, uh,
5 to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, uh, I believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh from society,
6 Right.
7 Yeah.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure
2 Yeah,
3 you're, you're right there.
4 Uh, I
5 basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that I just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Right.
8 Right.
9 I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Right.
2 so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,
3 Uh-huh.
4 so I, I'm all in favor of it.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Well, uh, do you, uh,
7 are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?
8 Well, I, I really don't know on that question.
9 It just seems like,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.
2 I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
3 Uh-huh.
4 and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,
5 so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
6 Right.
7 and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live,
8 but, you know, then you're kind of playing God which is never a good thing to do.
9 That's true,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah.
2 Right.
3 But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of.
4 I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or serial killers
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.
8 I think that they're, they're operating on a more,
9 I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because they're feeding our consumer needs.
2 Right.
3 Sure,
4 yeah,
5 I understand, I understand your point.
6 Yeah.
7 Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next
8 and they do have the death penalty.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yeah.
2 Yeah,
1 Hi
2 you want to start first
3 Of course.
4 We are talking about the elderly and, uh, whether or not we we like nursing homes
5 Right.
6 and, as a matter of fact, I can tell you something about that.
7 Uh-huh.
8 You apparently have somebody there, in one.
9 No,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 actually, my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
2 and her mother,
3 Oh, you are kidding?
4 No,
5 she did.
6 Oh.
7 And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home, for years. And then, uh, went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
8 Uh-huh.
9 I will be darned.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And, uh, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.
3 Oh, for heaven's sake.
4 So, I do know something about that.
5 You are very, very much aware of what goes on.
6 Absolutely.
7 That is great.
8 Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business, was that her mother was very old, and couldn't seem to find companions.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 She was lonely.
5 Right.
6 And she needed company, for her mother
7 Right.
8 and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies.
9 I will be darned.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And then, uh, it, it grew into a, very prosperous business from that point.
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh,
4 uh-huh.
5 Uh, then they,
6 Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.
2 Well, that is not really true, either, uh,
3 I think that is a stigma and an I, and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences.
4 Uh-huh.
5 You see, those who had bad experiences talk about them.
6 Uh, right,
7 right.
8 And those who do not may write, a letter to the nursing home and say you did good,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 but they do not talk a whole lot about that.
3 That is true.
4 But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home, when you are still able to have good, relationships with, maybe other friends they wait until they are, you know, unable.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Sure.
9 Well now, That is right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, that is because they wait until the children make those choices, they choose to not make those, choices themselves.
2 Right.
3 Right,
4 right.
5 However, my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And, uh, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home.
8 And these, these,
9 Uh, uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her. "Well I am going for my, tennis lessons.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And, uh, would would you, you know, call down and have the van come around and take, us for our tennis lessons."
4 Uh-huh,
5 uh-huh.
6 And they are very active and very enthusiastic
7 and they have, some excellent programs right there on site.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.
2 Yeah.
3 That is great.
4 Or, or one of the lovely cafeterias.
5 And they have, you know, pink linen napkins for their dinners. And, a well equipped library.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 Yeah,
9 that sounds great.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home
2 and I think when the, the parent gets old enough, to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping house, and with taking care of themselves, anymore. That is a wonderful alternative.
3 Yeah.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 It is expensive.
8 It is costly.
9 See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it is, you, know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Well, now my daddy's mother, uh, lived in a, a retirement village
3 and she and her sister had side by side duplexes, one bedroom duplex.
4 Uh-huh.
5 She still had her individuality,
6 Uh-huh.
7 but they were there close
8 and they did have, uh, you know, the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
9 and, there were lights that you could flip on and so forth.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And they have security.
3 Uh-huh.
4 No,
5 I am very much in favor,
6 I have heard horror stories,
7 Oh, well you have that with anything.
8 I know that the elderly can easily be abused,
9 Oh yeah .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are, they are in, homes of their own children.
2 In the homes, yeah.
3 Well, we used our nursing home as, uh,
4 Uh-huh.
5 like when my sister was real bad before she died uh, we took her the last month and a half, into a nursing home.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And they were super with her.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Absolutely.
2 They were, uh,
3 Well now, my grandmother,
4 of course all of my folks lived to be very old
5 Uh-huh.
6 and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease, when she was in her late eighties, uh, late seventies, I mean.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 She went to the doctor,
2 she had surgery,
3 she got the treatments
4 and during, the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home.
5 Uh-huh,
6 uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 She got better,
9 she got well,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 she got out and went dancing again.
2 Well, a lot of people do that.
3 They , left them temporally maybe they had a, broken hip or something or,
4 Uh-huh.
5 That is right.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 I think it is a wonderful interim place,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital, problems
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 and yet it is not, you know,
5 you have,
6 And it can become home to them.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 It, It depends upon the individual.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It certainly is.
2 It certainly does,
3 but, you see, we have had excellent experience with that.
4 And, uh, I, I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill,
5 but, I would not object to going to one.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 I might, I might like to be, uh, coherent enough to make my own choice.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 uh-huh.
3 Uh, I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say, "well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and, then dump me there.
4 This is
5 and,
6 But, I would  like,
7 There has to be  consideration taken on everything.
8 That is right.
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 uh-huh.
2 And I think you would shop for a nursing home, just like you would shop for a church, or a doctor or anything else.
3 Yeah.
4 That is right,
5 you would look into it thoroughly and, do, do the best job you could in choosing one.
6 Uh-huh,
7 sure.
8 Uh-huh.
9 When you get to the point where you are in trouble, and you have got to have that help, you are in no position to make those choices.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 No
3 and you do not have the time to look,
4 that is what, I am saying,
5 That is right.
6 Uh-huh.
7 most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.
8 Absolutely.
9 I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day, and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft programs, perhaps, work on some music programs,  whatever their talents are.  And work with, those senior citizens.
3 Whatever their talents,  yeah.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah,
6 I have a cousin who is, uh,
7 she had a son that was epileptic from birth,
8 and he did fine, at home,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 they lived on a farm,
2 Uh-huh.
3 but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone, she did not want her, her children, her other children burdened with his care.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 That is right.
7 So he, they, she has made arrangements that when she, she was gone, that he would go into the nursing home.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And he has, I would say, he adjusted very well
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, uh, he, he, he has been there quite a long time.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And, uh, he don't know me usually
4 Yeah.
5 So, he goes wheeling down, uh, the hall to bingo.
6 Somebody else, is helping him out, you know,
7 That is right.
8 Uh. Well, one of the things, I think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine.
9 and, uh, he has adjusted very well.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 oh yes.
3 Yes.
4 Routine and, uh, constancy.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh
8 Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over.
9 I do not think they pay, the nursing home staff sufficiently, to, to get the dedication that they have in some other profession,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh-huh.
2 To keep them there, uh-huh.
3 True.
4 and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,
5 Yes.
6 But , for some reason people resist, uh, the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.
7 And, uh,
8 That is right.
9 It seems to be a resistance.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Care for the elderly and care for the children, I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, a more, uh, better area to invest, your money.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Right,
5 right.
6 But there seems to be a resistance.
1 Okay.
2 Guess we can go ahead.
3 Uh, well, I guess you know it's, you know,
4 since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day.
5 Uh-huh.
6 So, do you work?
7 Yes,
8 uh-huh,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I do work.
2 Oh.
3 Uh, and,
4 but I work at a manufacturing plant,
5 so I wear a lot of blue jeans,  and  T-shirts.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress,  and  high heel shoes
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I feel really uncomfortable doing that
2 and,  in  the plant so, uh, it's, it's a problem for me.
3 Yeah.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Very, very, comfortable.
8 I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home
3 and, I work at home,
4 so,  I  just have, you know, I just wear my, you know, my shorts and stuff like that.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 But when I,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 before I got married, you know, I was working
2 so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then
3 but,
4 Right
5 Worry about all that kind of stuff
6 Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working,  uh,  I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 but  now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching,  and  training,
3 Uh-huh.
4 and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal,  garb
5 When you're training, right.
6 Yeah.
7 Than your normal garb
8 But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 moved from,  Winter.
2 and I had mostly polyesters and,  wools  and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes,
3 Uh-huh.
4 and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.
5 Uh-huh.
6 That's really,
7 that's been a problem for me.
8 Yeah,
9 because I came from Wyoming
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I had wool suits and wool skirts
2 and, You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear,  because  you can't wear them here.
3 Right.
4 Right.
5 And, uh, the seasons are just so much different.
6 You have so much summer.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
9 That's true, that's true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah
2 Well, I know, I was just now, uh, uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,
3 Uh-huh.
4 and  I was going through here
5 and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years.
6 Yeah.
7 And, because it's a wool skirt
8 and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And I have five or six wool skirts,
2 Uh-huh.
3 so  I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,
4 but no, I folded it up neatly and put it away  maybe next year
5 Yeah.
6 You hate to  get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh.
9 And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So,
2 Well, I know last year, uh, well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold.
3 Uh-huh.
4 But the previous winter we had more, uh, cold weather where I was able to actually wear,  your  double and triple layerings of, uh, clothes yeah, like you would when you're up north.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Clothes,
7 yeah.
8 So  that's  really interesting.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah,
2 yeah,
3 and I, I just don't spend, you know,
4 right now my clothes come from Target, you know
5 Yes,
6 yes,
7 yes,
8 and they're all one hundred percent cotton
9 and
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 and they,
3 you take them out of the drier
4 and they're wadded up in a ball.
5 Yes,
6 yes,
7 I know.
8 Oh
9 I'm so glad to meet somebody that, that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It is, it is.
2 You know, I have very little furniture,
3 but  my ironing board is part of my decor
4 so,
5 That's true,
6 and, and I've been looking at these, uh, uh, like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got, that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh, uh, what, the, the, the door.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, uh,
9 and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it,  permanently  attached,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom
3 and it's just, it's just an eyesore, I think,  with  all the,
4 Yeah,
5 well, yeah
6 it is, it is,
7 but it's like, uh, I just don't want to do it
8 Uh-uh,
9 uh-uh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 No.
3 I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet,  and,  and running, you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there
4 Uh-huh.
5 and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore
6 Yeah
7 that's an idea.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, I have a big closet.
2 Yeah,
3 I, you know,
4 if I have,
5 if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room,  I  will put it away,
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeah
8 but I  iron our clothes as we go along,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so,  you know,
2 I no longer do that weekly thing,  because I  have so many,
3 Right,
4 no.
5 and I'm like you,  I,  the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need
6 Uh-huh.
7 and that's it.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Because it's too many,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 hundred percent cotton.
2 Uh-huh.
3 You can't iron it all
4 and,
5 Uh-huh.
6 Yeah.
7 And then with my kids, they're always getting into, you know,
8 they can't decide what they want to wear so they,  change  their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 but she's still changes her mind two or three times,  before  she figures out what she's going to wear
2 Right.
3 so,
4 Right.
5 Oh, I know, I know.

7 No,
8 no
9 of course not.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No,
2 that, uh, that would be too simple.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah,
5 Absolutely not
6 That's right.
7 Our lot in life is to make her life miserable
8 so,
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 absolutely, absolutely.
2 Uh.
3 Oh.
4 Yeah,
5 well that's,
6 it's been good talking to you, to see somebody, hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do
7 and they just go, oh, how do you do that?
8 It's like, it's easy, you just do it, you know.
9 That's right
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 So, uh,
3 but, yeah,
4 I, uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, uh, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, uh, an ever present thing in our household
5 so,
6 Yeah,
7 yeah.
8 I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, you know.
9 My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 There you go.
2 You know.
3 Things that need to be mended,  things  that have to get ironed,
4 Yeah.
5 He wouldn't know where to put things
6 so,
7 Uh-huh,
8 uh-huh,
9 uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's true.
1 Tell me what you like to do.
2 Well, I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business,
3 but it's a little sideline, part time thing.
4 Oh.
5 Uh-huh,
6 wonderful.
7 And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here.
8 Oh.
9 Wonderful.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah,
2 it's really neat.
3 And, uh, uh, course I've been working on it for five years,
4 but, you know,
5 Oh, but how wonderful.
6 Are you close to getting it done?
7 Yeah,
8 yeah,
9 it's getting real close to
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done,
3 and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,
4 but, uh,
5 Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
6 No,
7 actually, uh, I'm not even sure,
8 I may,
9 I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh-huh,
2 kind of your getaway place.
3 Yeah,
4 escape.
5 But it's beautiful,
6 it's, you know, it's Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest,
7 there are a lot of pine trees,
8 but it's mostly oaks
9 and .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, how beautiful,
2 and it's pretty flat there?
3 Well, it's kind of, hilly,
4 but, it's, you know, low hills,
5 it's not, uh,
6 See, I've only been to Texas once.
7 I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas,
8 and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
2 You,
3 I liked the hills and the trees,
4 Yeah,
5 in
6 Yeah,
7 it's really different because that's kind of the, you know, that's the chalk hills down there,  limestone hills,
8 Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 except for time in service.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Born and raised Texan, huh.
4 Yeah. At, at which one?
5 Well, I had never been there,
6 that's pretty neat.
7 My sisters both seem to like it pretty well.
8 My brother-in-law works for the University, um, in Dallas.
9 He's admissions director.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.
2 Oh, okay
3 Yeah.
4 it's just north of me here.
5 Yeah,
6 well that's, he's got a job there
7 and this is his first year,
8 so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
9 That's great.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But they seem to like it okay.
2 I think they're too far away from me,
3 but maybe some day they can get closer,
4 Well, yeah,
5 we'll see.
6 Pretty good trip.
7 So what do you, what kind of hobbies are you in?
8 Well, I'm mother of four,
9 so basically I'm just, real busy with my kids right now in sports,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight,
2 and, I substitute at the schools part-time.
3 Oh, that's great.
4 Well, I am a travel agent at heart,
5 and my hobby is just,
6 I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh,
7 but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,
8 so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
9 No, kidding.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,
2 and I'm enjoying it.
3 I'm around my kids
4 That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?
5 yeah,
6 it's great,
7 it's great,
8 and what else do I do,
9 I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Ooh.
2 and I enter things in our little state fair,
3 and that's pretty fun.
4 That's great.
5 Well, but, actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports. Tennis,
6 I play tennis.
7 Ooh, I love tennis too
8 Ooh,
9 do you?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I ski, ski,
2 do you ski?
3 Yes,
4 we snow ski.
5 We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon,
6 Uh, that's great.
7 have you ever been there?
8 No, uh,
9 Wonderful place.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I've skied in Colorado
2 and we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper, you know.
3 Ooh.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Where in Colorado?
6 I've been to Telluride which is on the west side and, uh, Copper,
7 Yes,
8 yes.
9 Copper is kind of my favorite up there. Breckenridge and Keystone.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really.
2 Uh-huh.
3 I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.
4 I would love,
5 I can hardly wait to get up there.
6 Me, too.
7 You guys, are you guys getting snow?
8 We,
9 it is snowing right now.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 We're to get one to three inches tonight.
2 Oh, gee,
3 I heard Aspen got three feet.
4 Oh, yeah,
5 well we're, we are on the dry side of the mountains.
6 Seattle is only about two and a half hours,
7 so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
8 Yeah.
9 and, um, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I can imagine, my lord.
2 And, um, so, and we're on the colder side,
3 they're on the rainy side,
4 we're on the snowy side
5 and, um, we, we ski.
6 My, my children all ski
7 Oh, super.
8 and we've, we have been to Whistler in Canada, which is just a marvelous place,
9 Whistler and Black Home is in Canada,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times,
2 that's a, just a great place. But no not in Colorado
3 since I was in college, since I went to school,
4 What about Utah?
5 Haven't been there,
6 I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and,
7 Yeah,
8 haven't either.
9 um, to don't, Adam, talking to um City,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Always want to go to Canada Canada to Banff or somewhere like that
2 Ooh, yes.
3 And your kids all ski?
4 Uh, not all of them
1 So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?
2 I think in some professions it's, uh, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.
3 Yeah.
4 We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, uh, train conductors uh, on drugs.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently,
7 and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana,
8 I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay
9 Oh, my goodness,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it would,
2 that would, tied up traffic for a long time,
3 everybody died,
4 the fire was terrible,
5 it was awful.
6 So, yeah,
7 I think you're right,
8 I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field,
9 but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They,
2 that's, that is a problem
3 and every time before they get into a vehicle I mean.
4 Right,
5 yeah
6 I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested
7 Uh-huh.
8 I don't know,
9 even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 that make sense?
3 Yes,
4 uh, it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh career.
5 Yeah,
6 and then, uh, I think,
7 Yeah.
8 I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone
2 Right.
3 Uh-huh
4 I don't, I don't know.
5 however, here in Dallas uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team
6 Yeah.
7 Uh-huh.
8 and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,
9 and was to the point, he was on probation,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract,
2 and they wouldn't have to pay him,
3 and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him,
4 but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract
5 Right.
6 and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice
7 and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem
8 and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.
3 Get rid of him.
4 Right,
5 yeah.
6 And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,
7 he's been in the paper, in jail,
8 and it's just been awful
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and talk about a terrible role model,
2 Right,
3 I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible you know,
4 it's really funny though, um,
5 I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school
6 Um.
7 Oh, my goodness.
8 and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school
9 and a friend came and got me,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I was there,
2 and I could smell the dope,
3 and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
4 Uh-huh.
5 and nothing ever happened,
6 and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,
7 Oh, that's terrible.
8 Uh-huh.
9 but I really, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm so anti drunk driving,
2 and, and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects
3 Uh-huh.
4 and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on the subject.
5 I think most of us are.
6 Yeah,
7 but as I've, as soon as that happened,
8 I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.
2 Yes,
3 if you know someone,
4 for example we have, uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver
5 Uh-huh.
6 the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,
7 and, uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school
8 Right.
9 he went through surgery after surgery
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff.
2 and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.
3 And he,
4 as far as his athletics, he's lost all of that.
5 Right.
6 He, uh, has been tutored,
7 and he'll catch up in school and everything,
8 but, he's still not back where he was.
9 Right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 I don't think somebody,
3 He may never have  all those motor skills back.
4 Yeah,
5 you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.
6 No.
7 I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life.
8 You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.
9 Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.
3 Well, he, the train missed him,
4 but, uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head
1 Okay.
2 Yes.
3 Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.
4 Uh-huh.
5 She goes out
6 but I mean she's an indoor dog.
7 Yes.
8 And two outside cats.
9 Oh, gosh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Male and female.
2 And how long have you had them?
3 The
4 the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.
5 And the cats are, they might be as old.
6 I'm not sure
7 Yeah.
8 Well, that's interesting because we have a
9 we don't have cats
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but we do have a dog, who is an indoor dog,
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 and she is going to be thirteen this summer
5 so,
6 Oh, is that right?
7 What kind of dog do you have?
8 Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.
9 Oh, that's what ours is
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Is that right?
2 Yes.
3 Isn't that interesting
4 What color is your dog?
5 White.
6 Oh, well, ours is black,
7 so
8 Oh, uh-huh.
9 definitely different
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'll be darned.
2 Yes,
3 she's a female
4 and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.
5 Um, she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of, follows me around all the time,
6 Uh-huh.
7 Oh.
8 Yeah.
9 and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 She doesn't hear very well
2 and,
3 Uh-huh.
4 she doesn't see very well
5 but she's,
6 Well, that's to be expected at, their age.
7 Yeah,
8 at this age, I guess so.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But, um, she's been a good dog to have,
2 and I don't know,
3 once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not
4 Well, everybody always says no more
5 Yeah,
6 yeah.
7 But I, I think animals are really important in the family.
8 I,
9 I agree,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yes.
2 Um, did you get yours as a pet for your
3 do you have children?
4 Uh, yeah,
5 we, have five.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before
9 or,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.
2 She was fifteen when she died.
3 My goodness.
4 And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,
5 Uh.
6 a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody,
7 Uh-huh.
8 people drop things like that off, up there,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."
3 I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"
4 Oh, yeah.
5 Go get her.
6 So that's how we got her, quite by accident.
7 Isn't that,
8 Yes.
9 So that often happens that way.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.
2 We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went, then we went out then, and found one,
3 Uh-huh.
4 she was in the litter,
5 Uh-huh,
6 uh-huh.
7 and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.
8 I mean, they were all over the place,
9 and she was real docile and, came over and just kind of sat next to us,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 and I thought, that's the dog for me
3 Oh.
4 She picked us
5 Yeah,
6 so she,
7 and it,
8 what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,
9 let's see,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, um, she just loved this little dog, to pieces
4 Oh.
5 but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.
6 I think, she was always a little bit leery of her.
7 Oh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.
2 Oh, for heaven's sake.
3 So you just never know how that works out
4 No.
5 But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,
6 Uh-huh,
7 yes.
8 they want to and tell them anything they want to
9 and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah.
2 That's right.
3 or
4 That,
5 yes,
6 they're very, unjudgmental
7 Yeah.
8 Yes
9 Oh, dear
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.
2 Yes,
3 I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh,
6 and how,
7 Our one, our one nursing home in has one.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Permanent
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Is that right?
2 He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is or somebody takes care of him.
3 Isn't that amazing?
4 But he goes out people,
5 and real nice dog, uh,
6 and, uh,
7 Uh-huh,
8 yes.
9 It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis
3 and, um, there were several dogs on the campus
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, and, the,
6 Oh, really?
7 what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,
8 but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.
9 And, um, I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 They were healthy, looking dogs.
3 Yeah.
4 But, um, our guide that day said that the , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard
5 Is that right?
6 Yeah
7 because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,
8 I know.
9 they just do not allow them.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 I know.
3 That's, that's kind of great.
4 Yes,
5 it really was.
6 It was just a nice touch,
7 Yeah.
8 and it kind of made it seem more homey too
9 Yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah.
2 But, um,
3 I thought that was most unique.
4 And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So, um, but, uh, I,
8 this is the only pet we've had you know,
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 in all our years of marriage, um,
2 and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs
3 but they were always hunting dogs,
4 Oh, uh-huh.
5 and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,
6 Uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 they were always kind of,
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 we've ruined them
2 Yeah,
3 right.
4 That's what he said.
5 They say ruined them
6 Yes.
7 So having a pet was a little bit different for him.
8 Well, we've had a lot of different pets.
9 We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and we also raised them for food, at one time.
3 Yeah,
4 Oh, yes.
5 And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about
6 Oh, my golly.
7 She was in the house
8 Oh, gosh.
9 Isn't that interesting?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.
2 Well, don't ever get one for a pet.
3 Oh.
4 They're okay,
5 but like she, uh,
6 they don't ever learn their name.
7 Oh.
8 Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you had to go chase her down.
2 I'll be darned.
3 How interesting.
4 And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.
5 But,
6 Uh-huh.
7 I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.
8 They,
9 before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 And, uh, they're not
3 I mean, they use the litter box.
4 That's about it .
5 Isn't that interesting?
6 That's, that's really something.
7 Um, how long did you have that?
8 Oh, my, how, how long?
9 Probably seven or eight years.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Goodness sake.
2 And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"
3 so, we moved her to the basement,
4 and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, built her a pen outside
5 Oh, my gosh.
6 Isn't that funny?
7 And I thought, I put up with that all those years
8 Yes,
9 and this is what it took finally
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, we've had, we've had cats, stay in the house. Different times.
2 That is,
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Right.
7 Uh, one of them ran off.
8 She ran off once,
9 or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 and the second time he never came back.
2 My goodness.
3 And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,
4 Uh-huh.
5 he kind of moved into a woods down there.
6 I'll be.
7 And he got huge down there.
8 My goodness.
9 He really grew
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but he, he never came back.
2 That's That's interesting.
3 I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.
4 Well, he wasn't a whole lot.
5 Uh-huh.
6 He was in the house most the time,
7 Yeah.
8 but, uh, he did go out sometimes
9 and, uh, they
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.
2 Is that right?
3 Yeah.
4 The, the cats,
5 my son has a cat,
6 and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And their cat was not a friendly cat,
1 Start.
2 What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?
3 Um,
4 well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,
5 and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatever other combination there is.
6 And, and I think they've got a uh, some kind of container for aluminum.
7 Plano's doing real good on that.
8 They have, uh, they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans. Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and of course it doesn't fit right now.
2 Yeah.
3 But now we start in May, breaking it down,
4 and they're picking it all up.
5 Um.
6 So they're going to by,
7 and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,
8 and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up from your yard,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and  we put that in disposable bags,
2 and they pick that up on Monday.
3 Um.
4 So it's really great.
5 I, I'm really going head, you know, completely for it,
6 I think it's marvelous.
7 Well, that's good.
8 Well, Rowlett had sent, sent out a survey, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.
9 And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably, because they're going to do it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't know how, how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,
2 but they're, they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months.
3 Well, does your, uh,
4 where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?
5 Um, I've never noticed that.
6 We don't have a, a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,
7 so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria. Um,
8 Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?
9 Um, no.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 There's, there's only one pop machine
2 and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,
3 so, uh, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.
4 So you don't have much choice there.
5 No
6 Not, not really.
7 Well I work at, uh, J C Penny
8 and last week they brought,
9 they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and they're going to recycle them.
3 Um.
4 So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.
5 Uh-huh.
6 And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in
7 and they brought it down to the shelters.
8 And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of for cans for people have pop,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they put them right near where they have the time cards.
2 Yeah.
3 And it works great.
4 And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.
5 That's good.
6 So they're really going at it,
7 and I think it's marvelous because,
8 Yeah.
9 I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well,
2 And I think they're trying to, to make some changes.
3 I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,  rather  than bag it up, because of all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and it's, uh, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.
6 Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?
7 I saw part of that.
8 It was good.
9 The only thing I thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water,  and  to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But I've already gone to,
4 oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,
5 but, yeah
6 I would say five years ago, turning off my fountain, I mean my water faucet,  in  the sink when I brush my teeth.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That  was surprising to me.
2 Um.
3 I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.
4 I'm trying to think,
5 I didn't miss too many,
6 I can't remember what my score was,
7 but I did exceeding well.
8 I was surprised.
9 But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That was a shocker to me.
2 Yeah,
3 well there are a lot of things that aren't,
4 I'm ,
5 that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,
6 uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.
7 I, I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.
8 Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,
9 and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it cost more than regular paper.
2 Um.
3 And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,
4 but, It upset me to realize that, hey, the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling,
5 Yeah.
6 but people aren't buying it,
7 so the cost of it is higher.
8 True.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I noticed that about things like
2 I I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,
3 but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,  what  the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.
4 Uh-huh.
5 So, in, in terms of that,
6 it's,
7 you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,
8 but the cost is kind of prohibitive.
9 Now, see that's recycling, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 companies that do at least go into it,
2 I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.
3 Uh-huh.
4 So that people would use this stuff over again.
5 Yeah,
6 it's a good idea.
7 It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,
8 Uh-huh.
9 and the recycle ones are better to use,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.
2 Yeah,
3 true.
4 And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.
5 I had to put my bifocals on to see it
6 Um.
7 That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.
8 Yeah.
9 You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,
2 it's not recyclable.
3 I, I'd heard something stranger,
4 talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the,
5 I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a, a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Oh, really?
8 And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,
9 and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Oh.
2 and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.
3 You know they're,
4 along that same line, they said they were using, um,
5 what is, oh, I know,
6 it was toilets. You know, the old ones? Smashing them up, because they're, that stuff there is great for, in road work.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Huh.
9 And I thought, well, that's good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And then I saw recycling on tires between, uh,
2 well, hoses were being used,  and,  uh, uh, soaker hoses, made out of old tires.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah.
5 What else,
6 something else was made out of old tires,
7 I was trying to remember what it was. Oh, I can't think of it now.
8 But I was, I was trying to get my, uh, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,
2 but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,
3 and then I forget to bring them in the store.
4 Yeah.
5 I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.
6 I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I never realized, I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.
7 Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.
8 I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in, in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.
9 You know what I'd like to see a little more.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I don't have any little tiny kids,
2 Uh-huh.
3 but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.
4 Yeah.
1 Okay,
2 I guess I'll start, um,
3 one, uh, big thing that, the advise that I would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their, let their child experience college in a kind of general sense.
4 I like large colleges because I went to University of Texas at Austin,
5 they have fifty thousand students there.
6 And I feel like that now if I went, if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have, have gotten as much exposure to different people and different, uh, I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.
7 That's interesting,
8 I went to a smaller school,   of probably three thousand, thirty-five hundred.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Uh-huh.
2 And I, I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,
3 Huh.
4 and  we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds,  and so forth,
5 Huh.
6 so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,
7 Uh-huh.
8 um,  one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand,  and,  and, you know,  different perspectives,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah.
3 I, uh,
4 but  it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of, sort of thing.
5 Yeah,
6 I, I could see, I could see that point, I could see how it would be.
7 I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, um, because like we would have biology classes that did, main courses that everyone has to take, I mean, hundreds of students in this class,
8 so,  actually,  yes, you were a number.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But, um, I, I just,
2 I don't know,
3 I'm thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.
4 It just seems like in a larger college you, I don't know, your exposed to so many more people from all over the world,
5 and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of, of the different cultures there,
6 Uh-huh,
7 yeah.
8 not that  it's, not that it's better
9 but I'm just saying that I think that big,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's one thing to definitely consider.
2 Uh-huh,
3 uh-huh.
4 I think, uh, a lot of, a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college,
5 a lot of the students that I talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor, um, they,
6 or they're considering going to Baylor,
7 they're also considering going to U T Austin
8 but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students,
9 and I have to tell them that just like, just like I live in Waco
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's a large city,
2 I can still function, in my own kind of area, in my own group.
3 I have a job,
4 I have my friends,
5 Uh-huh
6 and I'm  really not as, as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big, a big university, you're not as concerned about the entire university,  but  your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and things like that.
7 Yeah.
8 I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school,  but  what, what is the particular needs of the students
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, um, larger university setting,  some  of the students, um, when I was, when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 They needed, uh, at least at first,  they needed  a smaller setting that, that was more like family where they could get one-on-one,  from,  from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, where, when they had a little more self-confidence built up, oh, yes, I can do this, oh, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,
5 Uh-huh,
6 right.
7 Right.
8 Right.
9 and  so maybe to me the key would be what is a the, the students needs,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh-huh.
2 but it's these other things that you and I are, are keying off on,  that,  that are really more of an education that,
3 Uh-huh.
4 but they're the things that don't show up in,
5 On paper.
6 That's right,
7 that's right.
8 Uh-huh,
9 exactly.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's, that's one important thing that I think about school.
2 I'm, I'm not a kind a person that,
3 I didn't,
4 I, I was kind of a B student, I guess you'd say,
5 and I didn't really,
6 I was
7 I strived to be an A student
8 but it wasn't like a real priority.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be getting into as many organizations as I possibly could,
2 and, and one other point I was going to make, was that I can I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends,  because  you, like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows everybody,
3 Huh.
4 Yeah.
5 and  so, you probably come out of it knowing, and by friends, I mean, like contacts for when you get out of school, um, you know,
6 you just, you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with,  more  so at a small college then a large college.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah.
9 You may have gone to school with them
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but you wouldn't, you wouldn't know them.
2 Uh, I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college, um,
3 I guess, I guess now I've been out for,
4 I, I'm older than you.
5 I've been out for twenty-one years.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And I was looking at an annual last night,
8 something had it sparked a question,
9 and I went to a small private school,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 um,  and it was church related.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and  I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here
7 and I've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years, where I go to church now, there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as I,
8 Wow.
9 and  it's, it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 you  know, we weren't all out to be teachers or, or whatever
3 so we didn't have the same classes,
4 but we had a common thread,  something  that still ties us together,  twenty  odd years later.
5 Right.
6 Wow.
7 That's great.
8 And it's, it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things, those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I,
9 Right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 right.
2 I have  something more important to me than that.
3 That's great,
4 that's great.
5 Yeah,
6 that's what I, that's basically what I, and, when I first,
7 I've been out of college only two years now, so it's still pretty fresh on my memory,  um,
8 Uh-huh.
9 but now that I'm out,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 when I went into school, my parents told, well,
2 my,
3 okay, let me, let me go back to my, my sister now is in college,  and  my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her, on her, uh, diploma, etcetera,  and  so forth,
4 Uh-huh.
5 Uh-huh.
6 and, and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school,
7 and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics
8 and I wanted her to get the life experience,  out  of it,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and so it was, you know,
2 she went the academic way because she's a straight A student, which is,
3 I was going to ask who won
4 yes,
5 yeah,
6 so, she, you know,
7 that's probably,  you know, what she, what she wants anyway
8 but that was the big deal
9 and,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 In, in that case, uh, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed,  and  finding a school that, that met her specific requirements,  and,  and made the best fit for her.
2 Right.
3 Right.
4 And that, that's another point is that, the, a parent should tell their child to be or, or to give their child the leeway to choose their school,  not  so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do.
5 Yeah.
6 I think it helps,
7 a, now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to, uh, what's now U T Arlington,  because  it was there in my hometown,
8 Uh-huh.
9 I could live at home.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 But I chose to go to another school
3 and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school, he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money,
4 Huh.  Right,
5 and  I think I value my, my education more because I had to work for it.
6 uh-huh.
7 And because I knew all along that's what I wanted,  even though  I had to buck the family in order to, to do what I needed to do.
8 Uh-huh.
9 So,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 Well, that was pretty courageous
3 Um, I guess, I guess it was, it was my mother's support that got me through it,  that  and ten years of, of, uh, loans  after I got  out
4 Yeah.
5 Oh, yeah,
6 yeah.
7 I'm, I'm dealing with the loans right now,
8 Sounds familiar, huh?
9 Your,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 it's very fresh in your memory.
2 very,
3 every, every month
4 I,
5 That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.
6 Yeah,
7 well, sorry about that Tanya
8 Oh, well, I guess I'll get over it.
9 I'm sure it was worth it though.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah,
2 yeah.
3 Okay.
4 If, if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,
5 Uh-huh.
6 if  nothing else just those experiences beyond and, and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve,  whatever  you set your mind on,
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
9 and the, you,  you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make, to give you the, the potential to do whatever you wanted.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Okay.
2 All right.
3 Go ahead.
4 Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.
5 Yeah.
6 I don't know.
7 The question is, I mean, would I want to buy,
8 or would I, would I probably actually buy.
9 May be two different things.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.
2 If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.
3 No,
4 in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.
5 I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche Turbo .
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.
9 Oh, really?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me.
2 Yeah.
3 But I maybe would buy a B M W. Uh, or, or even a Volvo.
4 Uh-huh.
5 What do you have now?
6 I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.
7 Uh-huh.
8 It's actually the first car we ever bought new.
9 Oh, really.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Yeah,
2 we just, we, well, I have
3 my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.
6 Uh-huh,
7 yeah
8 me too
9 So what car do you drive?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 What is it?
2 Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.
3 Uh-huh,
4 we almost bought one of those.
5 Do you like it?
6 Yeah,
7 I do,
8 and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,
9 and I,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,
4 and mine is a standard
5 Yeah.
6 and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
7 Uh-huh.
8 it had a lot more pickup and everything.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Yeah.
4 Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.
5 Um
6 usually AVIS.
7 To what, AVIS?
8 AVIS.
9 Really.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah.
2 Huh.
3 I guess,
4 It's just because we're on,
5 I think of it,
6 I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,
7 but we have corporate contracts you know, with the various companies
8 I see.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so it depends on your destination, too.
2 Right.
3 Kind of strange
4 You work for a big company, then.
5 Work for T I. Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this
6 T I, I see.
7 Uh-huh. Um,
8 but yeah,
9 I, I, uh, I don't know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Maybe it would,
5 one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.
6 Oh, really.
7 Um, and it really saved us some big money once.
8 It did, huh.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time
2 Oh, my gosh.
3 and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,
4 and I had to pay twenty five for the,
5 Oh, that was great.
6 Yeah,
7 it was.
8 That's unusual to hear,
9 usually, you know something breaks,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you look at the warranty
2 and it's excluded.
3 Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.
4 Oh, I see,
5 okay.
6 Oh, you got your money's worth.
7 Yeah,
8 we did,
9 but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and of course I'm glad I did it.
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 that is good.
5 But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.
6 Yeah,
7 well, I've been lucky.
8 Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
9 Oh, no.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.
2 Bumper?
3 Oh.
4 It didn't actually dent the car or anything.
5 So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,
6 Well, that was good.
7 and the store will pay for it anyway,
8 Are you.
9 so. No big deal.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?
3 Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one
4 Uh-huh.
5 but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and that's a Legend
8 Oh, yeah,
9 those are nice .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 um, but it's, it's a used one
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,
4 and the fact that, you know, this this car that I have has performed so well,
5 and before that I also had an Accord,
6 it was a real old one
7 Uh-huh.
8 and, uh, I bought that used.
9 I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and it served me real well, too.
2 Uh-huh.
3 So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.
4 Right.
5 And.
6 Yeah,
7 my sister drives one.
8 She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it Legend
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 it's a,
2 I'm not certain,
3 but she's liked it. Um,
4 Yeah.
5 But, I, I have, I have never had,
6 and we,
7 in fact, what I'm driving right now,
8 we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,
9 and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo just to be a little, you know, little car that I could care less about
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah.
6 How did it go for you?
7 Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.
8 Hasn't left you stranded.
9 I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's just a, it's a cheap little little car just to go, you know, run around town in
2 Yeah
3 I know.
4 Yeah.
5 and, uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive.
6 I, I,
7 you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know
8 Really.
9 it's like too, too mushy,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it, you know it's an automatic,
2 Huh.
3 and
4 Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend
1 Here goes Sharon.
2 Okay.
3 Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars?
4 That's the only thing I found out tonight
5 Oh, you found that out tonight?
6 Yeah.
7 I haven't even heard that,
8 that's great.
9 I think he deserves every penny of it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.
3 Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.
4 Oh, yeah.
5 Wonder because football,
6 And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.
7 And a lot more games, right?
8 Yeah,
9 that's exactly right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Uh-huh.
2 But I think, let's see,
3 the teams that were there last year were, see, somebody from California,
4 I don't even know who won the pennant last year.
5 Beats me.
6 I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games through the years.
7 Yeah
8 Not lately though
9 We have been talking about this,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I tried to call earlier,
2 Uh-huh.
3 and we had made a list of all these, uh, baseball teams and the cities that they were from,
4 then I started cleaning
5 and I don't even know where I even put that paper
6 Threw it away
7 Yeah.
8 I was just cleaning and throwing,
9 Oh, gosh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Let's see.
2 The teams that,
3 I think the A's were in it last year.
4 The Oakland A's, and I think it was, I don't think it was an all California baseball.
5 Well, have you ever played baseball?
6 I played softball.
7 Well, that's what I did when I was growing up.
8 Yeah.
9 That was fun.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yeah,
2 that's fun
3 That's a whole different sport.
4 Uh-huh. in
5 Yeah,
6 let's see,
7 but I think, I think the Rangers need to go
8 and I think the Pirates will go.
9 And, uh, let's see,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Rangers have got a new guy this year,
2 I don't even remember his name either.
3 Do you ever go see the Rangers?
4 Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there, not very many people out there.
5 It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd.
6 Yeah.
7 I think it's fun,
8 I like just looking at the billboards.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.
2 Yeah,
3 it's nice at night.
4 Yeah.
5 That's when I've been.
6 It is.
7 Well,
8 And do you know anything about that new stadium,
9 have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No.
2 Yeah,
3 that, that huge
4 it's suppose to be a huge stadium
5 and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it.
6 And, uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center out there.
7 And your going to be able to buy your,
8 what was, no, wait about the liquor?
9 That's, that's in, uh, Texas stadium where the football players, play
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah,
2 so you,
3 and they're never going to let liquor in there.
4 Well, they're trying.
5 I know,
6 but they try every year
7 and every year they get thrown out.
8 It's so stupid because they let you take it in there,
9 but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh
2 But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,
3 and I heard that there's, uh, that you can bid on that stadium
4 last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you,
5 so.
6 Uh-huh,
7 right.
8 And it's going to go to the highest bidder
9 Oh Well, that's the way to do it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 so that could be your, you know, fifteen minutes of fame.
3 You hear that?
4 That's my kids turning on their music.
5 Oh.
6 to child in the Holly turn it down.
7 I think it's the Bart man, the Simpsons
8 Oh, God I stay away from them.
9 I wish I could
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I bet you do.
2 Well, where are you?
3 In Plano.
4 Okay,
5 I'm in Garland.
6 Oh, you are?
7 Yeah,
8 my my husband teaches in Plano.
9 Oh, what's he teach?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 C V A E.
2 Uh-huh.
3 So, what do you do?
4 I teach,
5 but I teach for Dallas.
6 Oh, you do?
7 For right now.
8 I'm trying to get out.
9 Is that a tough system to be in?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 Real hard?
3 Uh-huh.
4 Yeah,
5 I would think it,
6 I mean it's good because they, they try new things, you know,
7 but it's like, they'll try something
8 and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and you get tired of that.
2 That's typical bureaucracy though.
3 That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go
4 it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,
5 Yeah.
6 I don't know,
7 sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.
8 Well, but they can't be though,
9 they don't have as much money.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 Most of the time.
3 but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.
4 Oh man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration,
5 there's so many of them
6 You don't even know who to payoff, huh?
7 I mean, somebody walks in the, a classroom
8 and you don't know what they're there for, you know, when they're coming, how long they're going to be,
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 oh, how funny.
2 you know, it's just there they are
3 and they're writing the whole time
4 No communication whatsoever.
5 No.
6 I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything,
7 and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know, may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, you know.
8 Yeah.
9 Because, you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 or,
2 I know.
3 and they'll tell you they've written something down,
4 and you hope they're telling you the truth.
5 And you never see it.
6 No
7 huh-uh.
8 That's got to be frustrating.
9 Oh, it is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 How long you taught, taught in Dallas schools?
2 Uh, this is my eleventh year.
3 Ugh, that's about, uh, ten too many.
4 No,
5 actually it's,
6 now my job's good, much better than a lot, because I'm Chapter One,
7 Yeah.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and all I do is teach reading all day long,
2 Oh.
3 and it's just ten children at a time.
4 Oh, well, that's not bad.
5 No.
6 It's good,
7 and you've got a lot of federal money, too.
8 But hasn't it changed a lot over the years?
9 Teaching?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Oh, yes.
3 Or working in the system.
4 Yes,
5 when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my
6 and I said, okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, you know,
7 so I'll know what I'm suppose to teach
8 and they go, we don't have one.
9 We don't even know where one is.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Oh, God
2 And so I go, okay, I mean, you just, you did what you wanted to do,
3 How funny.
4 and now they tell you what to teach and how long and, you know, what day, what period.
5 Yeah,
6 you don't know which is, you don't know, which is worse.
7 Yeah.
8 No,
9 I know which is worse.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 I guess so.
3 Yeah,
4 being told what to do is worse.
5 Uh-huh.
6 So, how long are we suppose to talk for?
7 Well, you can talk for ten minutes
8 but you don't have to.
9 Oh, you can?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Yeah,
2 and no,
3 if you talk to ten then they come on and say, oh, you've extended your limit,
4 and please say good-bye within the next five seconds.
5 Oh, I haven't ever talked that long.
6 Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,
7 Uh-huh .
8 and we started talking about gangs, you know.
9 He lives in Cleveland?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Wow.
3 And, everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here.
4 Yeah.
5 But, she was real interesting.
6 Huh.
7 And then tonight this woman called,
8 have you taken any incoming calls?
9 yours is my second one.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay.
2 So hers was the first one I got, gotten
3 and, uh, and she was telling me all her problems, you know,
4 and it went over ten minutes.
5 Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?
6 Well, yeah,
7 we did,
8 but the topic was boring I thought.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 What would you serve, uh, if you were having a dinner party?
2 Oh, gosh, all the other,
3 the one I talked about the other night was good,
4 it was, um, about movies, you know, what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that.
5 Oh yeah,
6 I could go on and on about that.
7 Me, too, because we go all the time,
8 the guy I was talking to never goes,
9 he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I said, I see at least two a week
2 Ugh, neat.
3 So, that was real good to talk about that.
4 Have you seen like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
5 No.
6 You've got to go see that.
7 The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE, WITH THE WOLVES, WOLVES.
8 Yeah,
9 we talked about that one too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long
2 but I,
3 Oh, I enjoyed it.
4 I did, too.
5 I mean, it was just more for my money.
6 Yeah.
7 I didn't think it was too long at all.
8 Uh, he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch.
9 Huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And, how old are your kids?
4 One is eight
5 and one is eleven.
6 You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
7 It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids.
8 They usually pick their own.
9 I bet they do.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know, they've got it all figured out.
2 Yeah,
3 they want to see all the horror movies.
4 Well, and Ninja Turtles.
5 Yeah,
6 Ninja Turtles, got to have those.
7 But most of the time really we watch them on the video.
8 Oh, yeah,
9 you
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's,
2 Don't you?
3 Just massive rental.
4 well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, uh, taking them out to the show.
5 Going to,
6 I know.
7 Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one one time.
8 That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just, plug it in.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything, decent.
2 I know in
3 It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though
4 and they're cheap
5 and nobody has got them yet.
6 That's true.
7 Unbelievable
8 That's true.
9 We saw, um, HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 It was okay,
3 it was kind of slow,
4 and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end, you know.
5 It just, it,
6 I don't know,
7 it one of those movies it's not going to be around long,
8 it will be a dollar movie in no time.
9 Do you read?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Not very much,
2 no.
3 No?
4 I don't have the patience to read
5 See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.
6 Yeah.
7 Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.
8 You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 sure did.
2 Well, I was reading the book,
3 and it's called SHOELESS JOE.
4 Oh, really?
5 It was so wonderful.
6 And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this author,
7 so I got a, uh, book of his short stories,
8 and that's been real good.
9 Who is the, is the author?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Don't, don't ask me
2 Oh
3 The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.
4 Shoeless Joe.
5 Was it like the movie?
6 Yes,
7 Okay.
8 quite a, quite a bit.
9 But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 he wasn't in the book,
3 Huh.
1 Alright Allen.
2 Uh, the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know, in their, the society we live in.
3 What do you think has occurred there?
4 Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.
5 That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time.
6 Uh-huh.
7 But are, are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the, uh, oh my gosh, I can't think of the word, but for the, what they have to accept that's they are responsible for.
8 Uh, responsibilities is what I am trying to say.
9 Oh, I don't think so.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities
2 Uh-huh.
3 but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.
4 In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals.
5 By the same token, most, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.
6 Yes
7 I think  that's  generally speaking, pretty true.
8 Is that right and wrong?
9 And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, going is, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yes.
2 And that, uh, they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
3 Uh-huh.
4 and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.
5 Yeah.
6 Well, what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years?
7 Any individual thing
8 Oh, boy.
9 or is it just a general switch over?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I think it's generally that switch over.
2 And, and I think that switch over has been more in the work force.
3 I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force.
4 I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them, on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home.
5 Uh-huh.
6 So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.
7 Yeah.
8 and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household.
9 So do you think that is going to be uh, difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes.
2 Yeah.
3 I think also in terms of parenting.
4 I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
5 and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.
8 Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation, specifically?
9 Well, I, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Uh-huh.
2 and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
3 and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be
4 and I want to go back and do something else.
5 I think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.
8 Yes.
9 People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Well, I actually,
2 a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.
3 Yeah.
4 And the people.
5 Well, how do you feel about women in, uh, armed services?
6 Well, I think they ought to have the right.
7 I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to or my wife and my daughter going into combat
8 Yeah.
9 but I have problems with men doing that
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it.
2 Um.
3 It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it.
4 Yeah.
5 I somehow can't do that
6 I, was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home, safe, secure, and made happy
7 and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
8 and it, it really still bothers me.
9 I spent plenty of years in the service,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around.
2 I mean how are they going to protect themselves  so to speak.
3 I agree.
4 It puts them in a very bad situation.
5 I, I really don't go for that.
6 I think one of the other things that concern, has concerned me a little bit,
7 and I think I see some change in attitudes there.
8 My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and there's, uh, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force, uh, fulfilling herself.
1 I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.
2 Yes.
3 Well, lots, right?
4 Right
5 Finally.
6 Really,
7 what, what do you do, now?
8 Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, uh, Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have, uh, had a huge recycling bin, over at Resurrection Lutheran Church
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh-huh.
3 and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,
4 but since the price of paper has gone down
5 like it's about a fifth of what it used to be
6 Oh, really?
7 so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over.
8 Okay.
9 So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Do you live in Plano?
2 Yes,
3 I do.
4 Okay,
5 yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins.
8 Right.
9 Have you had yours now?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yes.
2 Yeah.
3 Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.
4 Oh, that's why I asked you.
5 Yeah.
6 and not everyone got theirs right away.
7 Yeah,
8 yeah.
9 And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, you know, recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 Right,
3 yeah,
4 we used to take ours there.
5 And, uh
6 my garage was just getting overwhelmed.
7 I know.
8 And, of course, I didn't go weekly,
9 so it became quite a big  thing,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 and, uh,
3 Right,
4 I'm really glad  they do it.
5 Uh, yeah,
6 I do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles And aluminum cans some,
7 Yes,
8 yeah.
9 but I don't use as many of those.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out
3 Yeah,
4 well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.
5 Uh, ha.
6 Uh, ha,
7 Wasting all your time and effort and,  Putting it in there.
8 Thinking I was safe  in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 yeah.
2 But, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this  system under control.
3 Got your routine down.
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah.
6 Well, I guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle
7 because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.
8 Uh, uh-huh.
9 So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah,
2 I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed in with the recycling.
3 Right.
4 That's right.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 And, uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, uh,
8 what are some of the things they don't recycle.
9 Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 just everyday regular batteries. Supposedly, you know, leak and, and contaminate the landfills
2 Um.
3 Right.
4 and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out.
5 Yeah,
6 right.
7 And they don't take,
8 Probably going to throw them in your trash
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that's what happens
2 because,
3 Well, there are places that take car batteries,
4 but I wonder if they would take,
5 Yeah.
6 I mean, not that it would
7 kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries
8 but,
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah,
2 but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.
3 Yeah,
4 that's true.
5 Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items,
6 I'm sure if people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often to, to toss out.
7 Right,
8 that's true.
9 Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
3 Oh.
4 Oh, is that right?
5 and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, you know, scanned it,
6 so I don't know why, what that was reading it for
7 Huh.
8 but, uh
9 Registering our garbage
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 they must be trying to keep track of  , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess.
2 Yeah.
3 I don't know.
4 Another,
5 Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year
6 Ooh, for those who are really cooperating.
7 Yeah.
8 Now, that would encourage it.
9 Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They've already got all this money out on hiring, uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them.
2 I'm sure they couldn't afford that.
3 Sure.
4 But
5 Sure.
6 uh,
7 But the garbage, uh,
8 now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Oh, yeah.
2 So that's interesting.
3 Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen.
4 Oh, it did?
5 Uh-huh.
6 Gosh.
7 And we we called the City
8 and, uh, they, they brought us a new one
9 and they did not charge us.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen.
2 Oh, my goodness.
1 Afternoon, Doug,
2 it certainly is, uh, going to be a pleasure to chat with you.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And I'm, uh, certainly was surprised to, uh, to hear from you.
5 Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas.
6 Yeah,
7 me too.
8 How did you get on this list?
9 Uh, through Nancy Dahlgren.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 She, um, she had somehow gotten the information from T I and was distributing it around.
2 Well, okay.
3 All right.
4 Well, now, what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy?
5 What ideas do you have on that, Doug?
6 Um, see, I'm not sure that,
7 I don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country,
8 but I think that the opportunity is definitely there for, um, people to invade your privacy when they want to,
9 I think it's, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 In what manner?
2 Well, it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.
3 It's completely trivial to, for instance, listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone, since they're just radio signals.
4 Uh-huh.
5 It's, um,
6 and let's see,
7 well, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?
8 Well, the thing that I thought they were, uh, concerned about was, was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and in reality in many cases, they knew, or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations.
2 And I thought was, uh, beginning to invade the privacy of people, because the things about where you live and, and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business,
3 and they in return, come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge.
4 To me that's an invasion of privacy.
5 Yeah,
6 I agree with you there, for sure.
7 Um, and I think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get.
8 It's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history, for instance, if they just, um, twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 It's, you know, possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change it if he wants to.
2 You mean your history in regards to, uh the charge card company or something like that?
3 Well, um.
4 Well, yes,
5 well, for instance, yes, um,
6 and they'll probably goes into other things, like, you know, your records with the government or utility companies or anything.
7 Do you consider these serious, uh, problems?
8 Um, uh, not, not yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread enough,
9 but I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Well, what should we do about it,
3 or what could be done about it, do you think to correct it?
4 Um I'm not really sure, because the, I mean society is going more and more electronic,
5 and there are certainly benefits to its doing so,
6 and it's hard to, hard to say whether the, um, risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not,
7 and I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't.
8 Why,
9 do you see any out for us?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I would think that, uh, information held on records, uh, by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and, and not be allowed to be, uh, to, given out by those companies.
2 Uh-huh.
3 I mean, it should be made a, a, uh, national or a state law to protect people so that, uh, you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies.
4 Uh-huh.
5 In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, uh, and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else, uh, you know, from the outside, so to speak then you would, you would feel more free to, uh, to go into detail with them
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeah,
8 I.
9 but, but we have no control of that now
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and then, uh, you, you're, when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you, you feel that it someday might be used against you.
1 Okay.
2 Um, I guess what, I guess my task.
3 I usually ride my bike.
4 I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.
5 And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.
6 The stationary bike is, is so, uh,  boring.
7 Boring.
8 But I have head phones,
9 and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so I either watch T V, or we have a fish tank,
2 so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.
3 If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.
4 It kind of takes the time away
5 and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.
6 But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,
7 and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.
8 But it's definitely a task.
9 You think so?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I can't say that I really enjoy it.
2 I wish that I did enjoy it more,
3 but I do it because I have to not because I want to
4 I bought a stationary bike,
5 but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.
6 Yeah,
7 yeah.
8 And I haven't figured how to get that soft,
9 and I tried even tying a pillow to it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.
2 Uh-huh.
3 And I love it.
4 Really?
5 I just love it.
6 So is it just women that go there?
7 Yeah.
8 It's totally women.
9 See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.
2 You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home
3 and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.
4 I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,
5 but I still don't like other people watching me.
6 I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess. Uh, feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low.
7 Yeah.
8 Right.
9 And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so there's no big deal all the way around,
2 but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.
5 Because, hey, you can do what you want.
6 You're a female,
7 and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.
8 That's what,
9 And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really?
2 That's, that's great.
3 Oh, yeah.
4 How,
5 And I  love the water aerobics.
6 I love the water aerobics.
7 Do they have a pool
8 or what is,
9 Oh, yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They've got a nice one.
2 Huh.
3 They have two types of water aerobics.
4 They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.
5 I've heard that that's really good for you to do.
6 It pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself.
7 Uh-huh.
8 So it is like double strenuous.
9 But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Because you're pushing it yourself.
2 Uh-huh.
3 So you're doing it yourself.
4 So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?
5 Huh-uh.
6 When you're in the water?
7 Huh-uh.
8 The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.
9 I end up having to quit for a while.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom  because,  I really jump a lot.
2 Oh, wow.
3 Well, that's funny,
4 I never would have thought of that.
5 Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.
6 So they just  wear them  right into the pool.
7 Like  Are they water shoes?
8 Is that,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber, you know, soles, so that, you know,
2 Oh, okay,
3 okay.
4 Okay,
5 okay.
6 no big deal one way or the other.
7 Huh, that's really  funny
8 But,  I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.
9 So no big deal.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Huh, that's,
2 But it's fun.
3 So, how often do find yourself going?
4 Um, on a, if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?
5 I try to make it at least three times a week.
6 Yeah.
7 That's really,
8 For a while I was doing it every day. Just, going, uh, five days a week.
9 Really?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.
2 But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week. Which I don't feel like is enough,
3 but it's, it's at least something.
4 You know, it, it,
5 I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.
6 But I know that I have to do it.
7 I mean it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.
8 Well,
9 But,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 When I was working up at, uh, The Summit, here in Plano, I'd leave there,
2 Uh-huh.
3 and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock. Oh, actually about four thirty because they start at five to six,
4 Oh, that's,
5 so I was there by four thirty, every night.
6 And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.
2 Yeah.
3 So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,
4 but,  I enjoyed it  higher.
5 Did you ever,
6 Well, I'm sorry
7 That's okay.
8 Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?
9 Did you  ever try that?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I have a,  I have a bad back,
2 so I'm very limited what I  do.
3 Oh,  okay.
4 It's like I can walk,
5 but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother  me.
6 Um.
7 Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,
8 it will bother me.
9 Then that would,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 yeah.
2 it will bother me.
3 I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?
4 Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.
5 I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.
6 Oh.
7 And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.
8 She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.
9 She says in fact you get more.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Wow.
2 I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.
3 Uh-huh.
4 I like water.
5 I'm not scared of it.
6 But I couldn't,
7 I guess I could swim across the pool,
8 but I'm no swimmer per se.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But I found that this worked really well.
2 And I came out of there
3 and I saw my stomach going down well.
4 Oh.
5 I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds. Just by watching what I ate.
6 Wow.
7 And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.
8 What if you're already on one?
9 I mean,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 What?
2 A diet?
3 Yeah.
4 I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?
5 Oh, no,
6 they have nothing to do with that.
7 Okay.
8 See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.
9 And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And they go over all your health and all your history,
2 and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.
3 So it became part of the package,
4 so I went through it.
5 It worked out well.
6 But they have packages  where they just offer the exercise program.
7 Is that what you're saying?
8 Oh, yeah.
9 You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I see,
2 okay.
3 I just  went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,
4 so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there, after all this time.
5 Um.
6 So it's like when I got laid off,
7 I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.
8 Um.
9 So I get all the same treatment again.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So it's kind of nice.
2 Wow.
3 That's,
4 Like I  said, I like it.
5 I like the heat.
6 I like the,
7 I jump out of the swimming pool,
8 and I go into the hot tub.
9 Oh
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And I love it.
2 Yeah.
3 That would be really nice
4 Because I have I have never,
5 let me reword that,
6 I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.
7 But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.
8 Uh-huh.
9 That's,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I knew I was pushing too far.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.
4 It's no big deal.
5 So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,
6 It's fun.
7 It's fun.
8 Uh, I've gotten on the bike.
9 And they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh-huh.
2 And I've  enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.
3 That's, you  know,
4 I wanted,  I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,
5 But most of  the others to me are very dull.
6 but I got talked into the bike instead.
7 And I don't know,
8 I really wanted a stepper.
9 I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.
2 I mean, I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them.
3 Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?
4 Um, I get bored very easily.
5 Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.
6 Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.
7 Uh-huh.
8 With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.
9 Huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So you have a little, you know, little,
2 you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so, to what your gear is.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, I,
5 it would depend upon which one you want.
6 I think now that I've had the bicycle,
7 I would go to the stepper.
8 But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.
9 Because you can buy a month's membership. And see what you feel is best for you.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Back by that.
2 The, uh, uh,
3 you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman, how women have changed,
4 Uh-huh.
5 uh, look at them,
6 in England, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, uh, Indira Ghandi , uh, in India,
7 Uh-huh.
8 so many, uh, women are heads of state
9 and I, you know, we, we keep saying oh yes, we feel some day a woman will be president.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 But, uh, I have some question, whether or not they will ever really get around to that.
2 I think we'll have a black president before we have a women president.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And, uh, I don't know whether that's bad or good,
5 it's just a point that I have observed that we,
6 Yeah,
7 I, I,
8 yeah,
9 I, I, I truly believe that, that before that, that we have to address the racial, racial issues in the United States, before we can go anywhere.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yes.
2 Right.
3 Um, because it is so, you know, it's,
4 Uh, oh.
5 Hello.
6 Uh, oh, I think, we're, we're supposed to hang up.
1 Okay, I guess we're on.
2 Yeah.
3 Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.
4 I wasn't in Central America
5 but, uh, talking about Latin America, I kind of, I consider Latin America to include Central and South America
6 and I did live in, uh, San Polo Brazil for four years.
7 Do you, do you think that, that we should have given up the Panama Canal?
8 Uh, realistically, I,
9 yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big enough to, uh, accommodate the, the shipping that it once did
2 and, uh, maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're certainly justified in, uh, our actions dealing with, uh, Noriega in this ...
3 Well, there are those that, that, that think that, that, that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the military.
4 Interestingly enough my father was, who was in World War One, and as, uh, as a civil engineer they, they, they offered him a commission as a captain if he would, uh, go in and, and, uh, help with the defenses of the Panama Canal.
5 He had worked for United Fruit Company there,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and they, uh, they, in fact, they had,
8 this was in the, the late twenties
9 and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, uh, he turned them down.
2 It, it's interesting that, that most people don't realize how small the canal is.
3 Have you ever been there?
4 No,
5 I haven't.
6 It's, it's really,
7 I, I haven't been there,
8 I've been to, been to Salvador
9 and, and, uh, in fact, we went back to visit some friends of, of my fathers, that we went in fifty-seven I guess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.
2 The thing I find interesting, though, is that, uh, is the whole colonial approach
3 and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we support, uh,
4 you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if you gave them a free election, they would vote for the,
5 Will you, uh,
6 did you ever studied the, the political makeup there, in, in, in Nicaragua.
7 I have a, a little bit,
8 I can't say that I'm, I would be an, an expert on, on the region,
9 but, uh, certainly, uh, I, it, it gets, it there,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 your,
2 you've got this, this toss up
3 or not, not so much a toss up but a, a dilemma when, when you want a country to have its, its, um, own, uh, dominion, or its free rein over its, its own people.
4 and now we're, we're in this dilemma over, uh, United States is, believes in democracy and, and self determination, where
5 but that
6 on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, uh, agree with the, or, not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about, uh, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only, you, we used to see spheres
7 but now we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.
8 Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was economic.
9 I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua,
2 uh, and, uh, there were, uh, there's a big, there's a big lake,
3 Uh-huh.
4 and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua,
5 but the, the United States, uh, had some,
6 and I've forgotten what the political influence was
7 but there were economic ties then.
8 The issue of, of
9 if, if it's in the economic interest of the United States, uh, do we go in and, and prevail
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, and, uh, in other words do we make the world safe for democracy,
2 Right.
3 but if there's no economic benefit,
4 and I think particularly if you're, if you're looking at the, at the, at the peasant, uh, whether he's in Central America, regardless of where he is, is his life, is his life better off under communism or, or uh, or Democratic government.
5 You look at Salvador where the,
6 Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.
7 Yeah,
8 and, and the question is, does the government make a difference.
9 If they'll mostly leave him alone, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and I think that's the difficulty they, that, that we have that, uh, it, it reality doesn't make, uh, doesn't make any difference if he has no income.
2 And apparently even some of our alleged, uh, Central American leaders that, uh, are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things,
3 so it's, uh,
4 Yeah,
5 well,
6 in looking,
7 if you look at the region in, in, uh,
8 to their detriment they came from, uh, this, uh, hundreds of years of Spanish control
9 and the, and the Spaniards have, uh, horrible history of corrupt, uh, government, greedy, uh, rulers who have been, uh, manipulating, manipulating their public for their own, their own good.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I mean, if you go back to the kings and, and the, the conquistadors coming in and, and the incredibly horrible things they did to the, uh, the native tribes,
2 I mean they make, uh, they make the things that Custer did look like, uh, like trivial.
3 And, uh, you get,
4 It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the exploitation
5 and, and, and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them
6 and, and Americans have, uh, have a pretty good reputation of exploiting,
7 you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and, and took it.
8 Oh, absolutely
9 and, you know we set up ...
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and we stole it fair and square,
2 An,
3 I mean, Ted, Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly and carry a big stick for, uh, for nothing
4 and, uh,
5 Right.
6 what's the, what's America's role there
7 and it, it, uh,
8 with, with other things going on, it, it seems to have lessened,
9 but you've still got, uh, Cuba that accepts, exerts some influence.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 The only, the only thing I see about Cuba though, is, uh, after Fidel Castro dies, I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore.
2 I, I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him.
3 Well, when you take a, a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class excuse me,
4 and that, uh,
5 you know, having a, a lot of difficulty, uh, surviving, uh, the question is would they, you know, would they be better off under communism.
6 Yeah.
7 and I wouldn't, don't know that I would advocate communism
8 but, uh, the question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the,
9 it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, is that, that's essentially an underclass
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 and when you get enough of them, uh, you know communism would feed them all.
3 well, I, I don't know if maybe communism is the right, the right word for it
4 but what we would,
5 there would have to be some kind of,
6 there, there may be a point at which, at which, you've, uh, you might want to consider some kind of socialistic, uh, organization or socialistic set up to, to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy.
7 Well that,
8 yeah,
9 if the guys got some incentive,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 if he's got, uh,
2 you know, if he, if he can raise enough, uh, coffee and bananas to, uh, where he's got something to protect,
3 other, you know,
4 Right,
5 right.
6 whether he can export or at least, uh, set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest.
7 But cocoa leaves sell real well right now, it seems,
8 yeah.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments.
2 Absolutely.
3 I don't,
4 it's going to be hard to, um,
5 we,
6 if you, you,
7 that, that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage, uh, or to make, to make him growing bananas profitable again, I mean.
8 Yes,
9 but the, but the question is, you know, if somebody offered you, you know, a thousand dollars a day to, to grow something in your backyard, would you do it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 Well not that we could be bought,
3 but, uh,
4 I've got to watch what I say here,
5 I never know when the D I A may be, uh, listening on my phone
6 Well of course, everything we're saying is being recorded
7 and ...
8 Right,
9 Of course,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 of course.
2 yeah,
3 it's tempting,
4 it's got to be, it's got to be horribly tempting for those, those peasants.
5 Particularly, if you're hungry.
6 Yeah,
7 yeah,
8 you,
9 it's not, it's not just a matter of, uh, of having an extra car or having a better car, this is a matter for them of, of feeding themselves their wife and their family
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, and you,
2 there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
3 and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
4 and ...
1 Hi,
2 this is Donna Donahue.
3 Hi, Donna.
4 Hi.
5 Ready to get started?
6 Uh, yeah,
7 I think so.
8 Okay.
9 Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay.
2 Well, what did you have for lunch?
3 Oh, it was, uh, it was,
4 I'm an officer in the Air Force, Yeah.
5 Oh.
6 Oh.
7 Well, that's interesting.
8 Okay.
9 So our topic is, is food today,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 is that,
2 Yeah.
3 Okay.
4 If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve?
5 Okay, uh,
6 do you want me to go first?
7 Sure.
8 Okay.
9 If I was having a dinner party I would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And then I would have, um, let's see. I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party Um, I would have maybe, um, say if it was like Greek night or something *sd um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek. And, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh-huh.
5 and then we'd have, um, like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And, um, let's see what else.
8 Um, maybe some rolls and, um, I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that.
9 How does that sound?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Jeez,
2 well, well, when is the party here?
3 Yeah.
4 Um, yeah,
5 that would take some planning
6 but,
7 I don't know
8 being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I don't think I'd, I'd be
9 I mean it, it's not a question of capability here to do something like that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It's just there's, there's no motivation.
2 That's right.
3 You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
4 but, um,
5 Well, that sounds good too.
6 I have, um, I have three kids
7 Uh-huh.
8 so, um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs
9 and, um, usually we just have very plain kind of, you know, interesting, not very interesting meals. Pizza and that all
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun,
3 but it's not a, not a regular thing. Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes,
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah.
6 it?
7 Yeah,
8 that's what they, they are shooting for here.
9 Okay.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um, let's see now
2 okay,
3 so you would have a barbecue
4 Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here,
5 Uh-huh.
6 and, uh, so it,
7 and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors,
8 Oh, sure.
9 like that's a little more a casual thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that
2 so we, really good place to do entertaining like that.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Oh, that sounds wonderful.
5 I just haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot
6 but, uh I don't know,
7 Uh-huh.
8 let's see.
9 I have had, well, one time I did have a dinner party.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I served a, uh, uh,
2 I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern, uh, southern food even though I'm up here in New York,
3 Uh-huh.
4 so
5 Oh, you are in New York right now?
6 Yeah.
7 Oh.
8 I'm, I'm in Texas.
9 I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Oh, yeah.
2 Yeah,
3 Oh, I see.
4 it is.
5 It's,
6 And I'm originally from Long Island.
7 Oh, no kidding?
8 Yes,
9 and now where are you in New York?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Upstate.
2 Oh, upstate.
3 Rome.
4 In, uh, Griffins Air Force Base.
5 Oh, okay.
6 Oh, okay.
7 Is that where you, you are originally from around there?
8 Oh, okay.
9 and, uh, been all over the place.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, wow.
2 That's interesting.
3 Okay,
4 let's see.
5 Um, well, I like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, um, everybody bring something,
6 Yeah.
7 and that's real interesting because then you get different, um, different kinds of foods and new recipes
8 and, um, uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and get the recipe from them or whatever.
2 And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food
3 because here in Texas they have lots of, really good Mexican restaurants
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could,
6 Sure.
7 do you know what a fajita is?
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yeah.
2 I've been down to Texas a few times, and, uh, had, uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there.
3 Okay.
1 Okay.
2 Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.
3 No,
4 I don't,
5 You don't?
6 but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.
7 My goodness.
8 So. Well, I have two daughters
9 and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,
2 Uh-huh.
3 so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.
4 Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.
7 Well, if I were
8 Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.
9 Exactly.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Exactly.
2 Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.
3 Yes,
4 I would think someone older
5 and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And I think that varies.
9 I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 that's true also.
3 Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.
6 Uh-huh.
7 So,
8 Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.
9 I'm twenty-two now
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.
2 But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,
3 well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,
4 but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.
5 The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.
6 Oh, uh-huh,
7 uh-huh.
8 You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.
9 Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,
2 I know I did this with my children,
3 it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.
6 Uh-huh.
7 because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself
8 so they, they thought, okay,
9 she knows how to, how to treat children.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes.
2 Well, see when, um, I first got my my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.
3 Um, this lady saw us at church
4 and she was a you know, she was a younger lady.
5 She didn't really know my mom.
6 She knew my mom by name
7 and that was it.
8 And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family
9 so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh,
2 uh-huh.
3 You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,
4 I thought that was pretty strange.
5 You know, and she had two children.
6 One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.
7 Wow.
8 So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.
9 So, I you know, I enjoy kids
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I get along with them very well
2 so there's no problem.
3 But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.
4 Oh, I agree with you,
5 but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,
6 Uh-huh,
7 that's true.
8 and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 So she was going on those two instincts.
2 Just the same I know myself,
3 I never,
4 and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.
5 Oh, I would be too
6 And, and in it really shocked me
7 because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.
8 She had just moved in the neighborhood.
9 She had her daughter with her,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.
2 And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.
3 Oh, my.
4 And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.
5 Huh-uh.
6 And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.
7 Uh-huh,
8 yes.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, I mean people are so different.
2 Oh, I know.
3 Um, well, I I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.
4 Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half
5 Uh-huh.
6 and I worked just a part-time job
7 and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in
8 and, you know, I made a few phone calls,
9 I went in and visited.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Um, that was a concern with me.
4 Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there
5 and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,
6 and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.
7 You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Well,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But I,
2 go ahead.
3 How did you stumble upon the day-care center?
4 Did you just look it up in a phone book
5 or what was it?
6 Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.
7 Uh-huh.
8 I think most people do that.
9 I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care
2 and,
3 Yeah,
4 there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.
5 Right.
6 Right.
7 And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.
8 Uh-huh.
9 You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yes,
2 exactly.
3 Uh-huh.
4 So there, there are just so many considerations.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?
1 Well, uh, if you had to pick a, a type of music that you like, would you be able to? *functions as a qw
2 Well, I could pick country music. *answered as if to a qw
3 Country music?
4 I,
5 As I've gotten older, I've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies.
6 Not originally.
7 Not originally.
8 Where you from?
9 Georgia.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Georgia.
2 Okay, well, see
3 I'm, I'm from Chicago,
4 so uh, I'm kind of in a different category here. Uh,
5 If you had to pick one, what would you choose?
6 Uh, I would probably go with,
7 it's tough, uh, I think I would just stick with the classics. Only because, uh, I like music just for music's sake
8 and uh, you know, I'm from the era where, you know, we had all the rock and roll.
9 I'm forty
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal
2 and, uh, that was a real interesting time
3 and, you know, the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound.
4 Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart
5 I mean because it's just,
6 it will always be there.
7 It's classic
8 and I don't have to worry about, you know, what's current and what's not because I haven't been current with music for a long time.
9 But, you know, same, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, as far as country music is, I've never really, uh, listened to it.
2 I mean because that's just,
3 it was,
4 it wasn't part of what I knew,
5 so, there you go
6 Well, I understand what you're saying.
7 I think if you would listen to it a little, you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the, both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that, that we both lived through.
8 Right,
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh
2 I,
3 it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too.
4 I, I know, well, whenever they talk about, uh, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me.
5 It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.
6 Well, there's some joy in it also.
7 But, mostly it, it just tells a story about life.
8 Yeah.
9 Well, I must say, though, uh, I listen to Amy Grant.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Do you consider her country?
2 I don't know.
3 I'm not all that familiar with her work.
4 Uh, uh, let's see. Well, name some people that are country that I should listen to
5 That would be good.
6 Well, I kind of like, uh, I like groups like the Statler Brothers. And the Judds, certainly.
7 Okay.
8 Oh, okay,
9 I, I must admit that's, yeah, they're fantastic,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so, uh, uh,
2 Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.
3 She's something, though.
4 She's got so much energy
5 That's true.
6 Well, I guess I, I have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that I do like some of that.
7 Uh, Dolly Parton, she's kind of,
8 is she kind of country?
9 Oh, yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Kind of
2 That's certainly where her roots are.
3 Right down there.
4 Uh, uh, how about the Oak Ridge Boys.
5 Very much so.
6 Very much.
7 Okay,
8 well, I like them, too.
9 So I guess I've had a smattering
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I just, uh, you know, picked,
2 I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north, you know.
3 That's true.
4 You know, so, well, I think there's music all around anyway.
5 I mean, I think life is just music,
6 so, you know, you can hear it wherever you want
7 and, uh, and I've, I've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because I just don't understand it.
8 But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like
9 so,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a, a record of the rap songs of the eighties.
2 Yeah,
3 the greatest hits,
4 right,
5 Yeah
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah,
8 so, I mean, it, it, it'll, if it stands the test of time, we'll see.
9 That's true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, uh, then it'll,
2 if it survives, then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, hey listen what we listened to
3 Yeah
4 Can you believe this sort of thing,
5 but, uh, you know, I, I think of,
6 I get real tickled when I listen to some of these old Beatle, uh, music, you know, the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still
7 and, and, uh, you know, all these rocks, rock stations call it classic soft rock, you know
8 Right.
9 But we used to listen to it full blast
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Of course.
2 Yeah.
3 So, it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff,
4 but, I don't know.
5 Well, you got any more?
6 Well, the big key is that, I think you've already stated, that all music is rooted in the classics
7 and it has grown from there. this short.
1 Do you use credit cards a good bit?
2 I do,
3 and I wish I didn't
4 Uh.
5 Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know  the cash  with me all the time,
6 Uh-huh.
7 but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,
2 and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA.
3 Okay.
4 Absolutely.
5 Right.
6 And so that's why I went ahead and got one.
7 Uh-huh.
8 It was a mistake
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.
2 Yeah.
3 I don't use them very often.
4 Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.
5 Yeah.
6 I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,
7 and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,
8 Yeah.
9 just enough to keep them active.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.
2 Yeah.
3 And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,
4 Yeah.
5 or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.
6 That's right.
7 Uh, and it saves a lot time.
8 And that's what I was using it for.
9 However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 you must have the money to do this with,
2 and you do not have any other options
3 Uh-huh.
4 so I charged all three of those cards up,
5 and right now I am paying and praying.
6 I know how that goes
7 But, uh,
8 and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Uh-huh
2 Uh-huh.
3 Uh-huh.
4 we had no way around it
5 Uh-huh.
6 and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh
9 and so like you were paying for it,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.
2 Well, I never did, Right.
3 I never did use it for an advance.
4 Most of my charges were, uh, medications.
5 Oh, I see.
6 Didn't have cash for the medications
7 or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.
8 Oh.
9 And, uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, uh, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 different labs will use those charge accounts for,
2 What,
3 Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?
4 I've found some doctors that say, you know,
5 I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,
6 and so many of them don't anymore.
7 Uh-huh
8 So,
9 Well, I have not,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.
2 Yeah.
3 I don't generally charge.
4 I say well, I need a checkup in six months,
5 and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.
6 Right.
7 I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,
8 and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.
2 Oh, it is
3 It is easy,
4 and it's very difficult to get out.
5 I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.
6 I know.
7 I say wow,
8 I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.
9 Big deal,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I'm saving two percent.
2 Right.
3 But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A
4 and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh-huh.
7 and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.
8 Right.
9 And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I, I think about young people that think, you know,
2 there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,
3 I have my first credit card
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.
6 Oh, yeah,
7 and it's not just paying back what you've charged,
8 You know.
9 it's paying that and half again.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 That's right.
2 That's right.
3 Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars,
4 you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.
5 That's right.
6 You only get half of that paid for the principal,
7 so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.
8 Right.
9 Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.
3 Right.
4 Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.
5 No,
6 and that's frightening to me.
7 Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.
8 That's right.
9 That's frightening, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Uh-huh.
2 Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself
3 Uh-huh.
4 I work for T I
5 but he doesn't
6 Uh-huh.
7 and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.
8 I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,
2 and after ten years he's got two of them
3 Uh-huh.
4 and they should pay through next month,
5 and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.
6 Oh, right,
7 right.
8 And, you know, just in one lump,
9 because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh,
2 uh-huh.
3 or it's like you say,
4 you pay forever.
5 Uh-huh,
6 uh-huh.
7 And so I'm really looking forward to that.
8 Well, you either need a big chunk of money
9 or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's right.
2 Now, those are very handy
3 Right.
4 if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem
5 Sure,
6 yeah.
7 I agree.
8 because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.
9 That's right
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
2 I know
3 and,
4 And it just irks me.
5 I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,
6 and I've got three cards.
7 I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.
8 I know.
9 You're like what am I working for today
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 yeah.
3 And that just blows my mind.
4 I, my house is paid for,
5 my car is paid for,
6 I've got some home improvements,
7 but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.
8 It's incredible.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,
2 well, my car is paid for now.
3 It was wrecked three weeks ago,
4 but, but you see again the credit cards came in handy.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.
7 That's right.
8 I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.
9 And, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.
3 Uh-huh,
4 uh-huh.
5 Uh, I went to a seminar,
6 they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.
7 You only use credit cards for investments.
8 Right.
9 I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 It's,
2 Sure.
3 That's right.
4 That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.
5 I thought God dang, where is his pencil?
6 That's right.
7 Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,
8 don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,
9 That's right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and, and so that, that is the smart half.
2 Uh-huh.
3 But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,
4 but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,
5 Uh-huh.
6 while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,
7 so we cut that out real quick
1 Okay,
2 is it Mike?
3 Yes.
4 Do you repair your own car?
5 I try to, whenever I can.
6 I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.
7 Well, I tell you what, that's, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 There's,
2 although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.
3 Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.
4 Right,
5 yeah.
6 Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?
7 Yes.
8 One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Is that right?
2 Yeah.
3 It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
4 and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.
5 And then start getting into these Nissans and the like
6 and I just can't keep up.
7 Yeah,
8 I, I agree.
9 About all I ever,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I never was too mechanically inclined,
2 but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,
3 Yeah.
4 Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.
5 That's right
6 But, Uh, they do still use plugs.
7 Yeah.
8 Yeah.
9 And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.
3 Yes.
4 I don't anymore,
5 but I have on a lot, a lot of times.
6 Yes,
7 I understand.
8 My last car repair actually had to do with brakes
9 and it's one I did not do myself.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I took the car, my,
2 I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected
3 Uh-huh.
4 and the parking brake failed.
5 So I got under there and messed with the, the that, uh, that adjustment to make, to tighten it up
6 Uh-huh.
7 and that didn't do the trick
8 Uh-huh.
9 and then I got there and tried to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It probably slipped loose, didn't it?
2 Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.
3 I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes
6 Uh-huh.
7 and it turns out that there's a,
8 the parking brake in the rear,
9 there's a, there's disc brakes
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and the parking brake is a piston deal.
2 Um.
3 And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.
4 Oh.
5 So they ended up having to pound it out.
6 And one of them, they, were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it
7 and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,
8 so I ended up having to buy one
9 and all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?
2 yeah,
3 actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,
4 but I, I don't, like I
5 Well, it was a lot of money,
6 but,
7 Yeah,
8 but, I,
9 it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 so,
2 You had to have the help, didn't you?
3 That's right,
4 that's right.
5 Yeah.
6 Well, do you still do much work on them, then?
7 I do.
8 actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September
9 and, whenever I can, I do try.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I
2 actually, I'd say this.
3 I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because,
4 Disposal is a problem.
5 Well, that is one problem,
6 but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.
7 That's true.
8 For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too
9 That's true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Right,
2 that, that,
1 Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater,
2 Well, I, I try to be as well,
3 Well, I'm not, uh, I,
4 there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really,
5 and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, uh, uh,
6 Uh-huh.
7 especially like good prime rib
8 Uh-huh.
9 so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York,
2 and there are a lot of good restaurants around here.
3 Oh, you're in New York,
4 I was going to,
5 there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib.
6 Uh-huh.
7 It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt
8 Uh-huh.
9 and it is absolutely wonderful.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really.
2 And, uh, we were there a few months ago,
3 and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,
4 well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,
5 but
6 Oh, no,
7 I'm in upstate New York,
8 and it's actually very inexpensive,
9 I,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards,
2 Oh, is it, okay.
3 Wow.
4 Uh-huh.
5 so that,
6 Yeah,
7 well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,
8 and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,
9 but it is absolutely wonderful.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 It's the best I have ever had.
3 Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,
4 so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas.
5 Yeah
6 Well,
7 Yeah,
8 well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food
9 Uh-huh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 sure.
2 so, um, that's,
3 I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.
6 No,
7 no,
8 I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,
9 but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 that they, uh,
3 I go on,
4 I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business
5 Oh, okay.
6 so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit
7 Uh-huh.
8 Oh, yeah
9 but, I love that,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 fresh seafood down there,
2 Yeah,
3 and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great,
4 you get the crabs
5 Uh-huh.
6 it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself,
7 Yeah
8 so,
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.
2 That's true.
3 But it sure is good,
4 and it's supposed to be good for you.
5 Yeah,
6 well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,
7 Right.
8 and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Do you like spicy foods
4 or,
5 Yeah,
6 yeah,
7 I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili
8 and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings
9 Oh, uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and so, uh, it, people, they, you know,
2 you go out to get the chicken wings
3 and those are really hot and the hotter the better,
4 Yeah.
5 Yeah.
6 Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it
7 Right.
8 Sure.
9 and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 But I like it hot,
3 but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
4 Uh-huh.
5 My, generally my, my scalp will start,
6 I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,
7 but, uh, I don't know,
8 but, uh,
9 yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.
2 Yeah.
3 Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,
4 I never been really fond of that stuff.
5 You talk about spicy,
6 that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,
7 it's so hot.
8 Uh-huh.
1 Okay,
2 what are your favorite things to watch?
3 Oh, uh, let's see,
4 I, uh, I have enjoyed, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING in the past, uh, now that it has gone off
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh, some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,
7 Yeah.
8 but,  what, what are your,
9 what is,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 We do not watch a lot of T V,
2 we try to watch it on Thursday nights,
3 we usually watch L A LAW,
4 I like that real well. And CHEERS
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 we like to watch that.
8 Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW.
9 Uh, do you ever watch that?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 uh, yeah,
3 yeah,
4 we, we we try to catch that most, most nights.
5 Yeah
6 And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons.
7 I was sort of sorry to see it go too.
8 Yeah.
9 It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I, I really did not think it, it was,  that  way.
2 Yeah.
3 I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it presented.
4 Yeah,
5 I thought a lot of the,
6 like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.
7 Yeah.
8 Just the dynamics of it and everything.
9 Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as,  as examples  of things that were going on
2 Oh, really.
3 and, and uh, you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,
4 Yeah.
5 and  that sort of thing
6 Uh, we kind of,
7 uh, our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along,
8 so, uh,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 that,  that tends to, uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, uh, it's, uh, very little T V time left.
2 Yeah,
3 you are too tired to do anything.
4 Yeah.
5 Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.
6 Yeah,
7 that's right.
8 Probably more worthwhile.
9 I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No,
2 I, I can not, uh, *typo? cannot?
3 I don't think there were, Uh,
4 I have not, I have not, uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to
5 I, uh, you know,
6 I, uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch,
7 but, uh, I uh, you know very seldom like to watch you know those,
8 there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.
9 I like, uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Right,
2 yeah.
3 it's, I  notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,
4 yeah
5 but it's, uh, it's on
6 instead of being on P B S it's on regular T V.
7 Oh.
8 But, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
9 and,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Yeah,
3 I have seen parts of that before,
4 it is interesting.
5 Yeah,
6 so I like to watch that
7 and uh, some, some things on P B S I like to watch
8 but, uh.
9 Do you watch sports much on T V?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Yeah,
2 if it's if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to be watching it
3 or,  or  I am not a big basketball or baseball fan, if it, unless it's baseball, if it's some, if it's a team I really like, I may watch
4 Yeah.
5 but, uh, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V,  for  an extended period.
6 Yeah.
7 It's slow.
8 Yeah,
9 it's so slow that you just get bored, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I, I will switch between something else and, and a baseball game going back and forth, you know watching it.
2 But, I usually,
3 if, if, if it's a football team I really like, a college team or, or pro team that I am fond of, I usually will sit and watch that.
4 But, uh, that's the
5 Yeah,
6 we are like that
7 and occasionally we will, like on, if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something,  we  will watch a little bit of a golf tournament.
8 But, uh,  you  can not take a whole lot of that either,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it's pretty slow.
2 Yeah,
3 it's kind of like,  like  baseball
4 Yeah.
5 Do you
6 we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just,  on  Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on
7 and,
8 Right.
9 I think that that's what more people are doing
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 and I think that's, you know,
2 as, as T V,
3 I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do, to do that, uh, you know, get more movies and watch.
4 Uh-huh.
5 I  know we, we have done that too in the past, uh,
6 we do not do it quite as much now, cause our baby will not let us watch them.
7 Yeah.
8 But, uh, you know, we usually will, we used to rent, uh, two or three movies on a weekend and, and try to watch.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Do you have cable T V?
2 No, uh,
3 We do  not either.
4 we live in,
5 I thought we were the only ones  who  did not have it.
6 No.
7 No,
8 we, uh,
9 the, uh, development we moved into was,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 they have it on one like right across the street from us,
2 Uh-huh.
3 but  when they built our section they did not, did not put it in
4 and we have been there about two years now.
5 Gosh.
6 and  they are still, still do not have it
7 so  I  am hoping that, that soon they will, they will,
8 Yeah.
9 I have contacted them about this
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and they say that well, it's, it's,
2 they look,
3 they, every year they look at, uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, uh, the most houses will be,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and  so they, uh, they look
6 and they, when they, when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in, put,  some  in, or they will at,  least  consider it,
7 Huh.
8 Yeah.
9 so.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Well, we had it for awhile
3 and it just seemed like we never watched it
4 any we did not have the movie channels,
5 we just had all the normal ones,  that  come
6 Yeah.
7 and we just never watched any of them,
8 we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it
9 and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Um. Yeah.
2 so we  decided to just cancel it.
3 It does improve the reception a little bit though,
4 that's the only thing.
5 Yeah.
6 I have, I put some, put in some, uh, an antenna, a really good antenna
7 and, uh, it's really helped, you know, ours
8 and it's not been too bad.
9 I have not really missed it that much,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 there's certain things that I have, that I want to see, you know, occasionally, like a football game, a college game or something that happens to be on cable, or some old movie,
2 but the, uh,
1 Well, we, uh,
2 taxes,
3 everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure.
4 But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases.
5 What do you think?
6 Uh, yeah,
7 I, I think so.
8 I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something
9 and I don't know what to cutback on to,  to get, to get that,  to get that settled.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 At this stage it's  hard, to tell.
2 And, and, uh, and, uh, I know I'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes
3 so I'm I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas
4 and, and,
5 Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because,  like the, the property  taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them.
6 Yeah.
7 I think so.
8 Yeah.
9 I know
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I live in Richardson
2 Yeah.
3 and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.
4 Yeah,
5 yeah.
6 But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals
7 and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you.
8 Yeah,
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah,
2 now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I,
3 we'd, when we moved to Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that,  because  we supported the,
4 Yeah.
5 Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,
6 and the public,  colleges  also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country.
7 Yeah.
8 Uh,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 one  of the,
2 uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition.
3 Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.
4 Yeah,
5 I think that's right.
6 Yeah.
7 That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.
8 Yeah.
9 The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 but I eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.
2 I, I don't, I don't know about that,
3 I, I,
4 Yeah
5 Well, I quit ten years ago
6 so I,  I couldn't afford to start  again
7 I see.
8 Okay.
9 No, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah,
2 well, that, that, that would be true.
3 That would be true.
4 But,
5 I know, uh,
6 my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.
7 Huh.
8 But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know.
2 Well, this, this is a thing
3 I think it's like, uh, back east.
4 You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities.
5 You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.
6 If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that,  and  had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it.
7 Yeah.
8 Yeah.
9 But now,  digging  tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 And,
2 Yeah,
3 and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.
4 Absolutely.
5 Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.
6 And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown,
7 uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. You know, like New York does,
8 Yeah.
9 yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Yeah,
2 just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.
3 Yeah.
4 New York
5 and some,  people  don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.
6 Yeah.
7 Right,
8 right.
9 Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.
2 Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.
3 Yeah.
4 And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
5 Oh, yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.
8 Yeah,
9 right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, uh, most people are that way. Because they're used to not having public transportation.
2 Yep.
3 Yeah.
4 So, but I,  here  again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt. So and doing all these studies and the things
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.
8 I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.
9 A little bit much.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Oh, yeah.
2 Yep.
3 Yep.
4 Oh, the
1 Okay,
2 there we go.
3 Okay,
4 great.
5 So, do you play golf at all?
6 Yeah,
7 I do,
8 I'm a player.
9 I'm kind of embarrassed I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that you are, you play a lot more than I do.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Actually, I don't.
2 Oh, really.
3 No,
4 uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit
5 and I was horrible,
6 so I just stopped playing.
7 Oh, well, my husband is, is a very good golfer.
8 He has got, like a six handicap.
9 Wow,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 that is real good.
2 So, uh,
3 and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.
4 So, I had to start playing because, he was, you know, such an avid golfer.
5 So, I have been playing now,
6 well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.
7 Wow,
8 so you have been playing,
9 But, but, I really enjoy it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.
2 Well, have you played recently?
3 No,
4 actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um
5 Oh
6 That seems to have been a mistake,
7 I don't know. Um.
8 Oh, that's okay.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I have not played in a long time.
2 Um, when I was,
3 about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him
4 and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,
5 I forget which one it was.
6 Yeah.
7 It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 the slice goes to the right
2 and the hook goes to the left,
3 I think.
4 Yes,
5 I was slicing, actually.
6 Yeah.
7 And, as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I went and took some lessons,
2 and a I got a little bit better,
3 but I but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,
4 and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.
5 And I, And I still have this slice ,
6 Yeah,
7 I think that's really a good thing to do.
8 So, where, are you in your life,
9 I mean, are you in school?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I'm a graduate student,
2 yeah.
3 Oh, okay,
4 at the University of Rochester?
5 Yes.
6 Oh, great.
7 As a matter of fact, um, so I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.
8 Yeah.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right,
2 so I hang around this way,
3 and I,
4 Sure.
5 Occasionally, uh, uh,
6 a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out
7 Uh-huh.
8 and we will, we will, we will play, you know.
9 And you don't, you don't have the length of the playing time that we do.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I have, I have very at the moment I have very little playing time.
2 When I, when I go on vacation, my father and I, uh play a little bit.
3 Yes.
4 But, I don't, you know,
5 we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.
6 Because, .
7 Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.
8 Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because, that's my, I can't hit a driver very far
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,
2 I use a three iron off the tee because, I have more control over it.
3 Um.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.
6 So, I'm still using a three iron
7 and my husband is trying to get me into using a, you, know, like a high number wood instead.
8 Right.
9 But, those are, uh, still not you favorite, huh?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 No,
2 it's not my favorite,
3 but, I, I, uh, I enjoy,
4 I, I really do,
5 I think I'm going to like golf the older I get, and the more time I have to play.
6 I, we have three teenage daughters.
7 Uh, wow, .
8 One is,
9 You must be very busy.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yeah,
2 I'm very busy,
3 I have a part time job
4 and, and during the year, I don't play much golf
5 but, but, when I'm, we are on vacation, I love to play. Just like you said.
6 Um.
7 And, we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, you know, along the Pacific Ocean, this past spring.
8 And that was, I told my husband, that was the way to play, you know,
9 that was,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 if I could play there every time I want, it was, it was great.
2 A neat experience
3 Miniature golf, there's my game. Uh.
4 Miniature golf is great,
5 yes.
6 Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.
7 Well, that's the thing my kids like to do that with, you know, on dates and stuff.
8 Uh.
9 But, golf is um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 we, we probably are talking about golf because I did check it You know .
2 I don't, I don't, I don't
3 I may have, actually, I may have just checked random things.
4 I don't, I don't recall anymore.
5 Well, yeah,
6 if you ever played,
7 I mean, I feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it
8 and maybe if you can even talk about it, if you, if you have, uh, watched it on T V.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah,
2 actually, we have a very very, um,
3 we had the, uh,
4 Yeah,
5 tell me about your clubs up there.
6 What,
7 Well, we had,
8 I haven't played around here too much.
9 We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 There, uh, the
2 Locust Hill?
3 Yeah,
4 the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.
5 Uh-huh,
6 right.
7 And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, uh, tour stop here, last year.
8 Oh, great.
9 And, actually, um, they say the, the,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I have not played the course,
2 but, they say the course is very, is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And it's, um, not only that,
5 but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.
6 Oh, yeah.
7 Because, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,
8 they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I,
9 but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 the course is so well maintained
2 and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to ,
3 but, they still,
4 the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.
5 Oh, yeah.
6 And this,
7 actually, when, when the, um, when the L P G A came here I guess that was about a week and a half ago, it was just, it, it takes over the whole town.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Oh, sure.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 You know.  It's all over the news,
2 and lots and lots of people take off work, to go to go an watch the, the, uh, ladies like some loss of words play.
3 Yes.
4 Yeah.
5 To watch them,
6 yeah.
7 The ladies,
8 So, I mean, I think it's actually, it's absolutely wonderful to see.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here.
2 Yeah,
3 uh.
4 People are just
5 golf is just,
6 it's just the coming thing,
7 I mean a lot of people are just crazy about it.
8 It seems to be.
9 It seems a lot of people are really, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 either, um, either you have not played it, or, or you, you have played it
2 and you sort of stink, like me,
3 Well, it's, it's just such a difficult thing.
4 and you sort of play every now and then.
5 I mean it's, I just, I watch my husband
6 and he's, he was a professional athlete,
7 he, he's a very good athlete
8 and he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,
9 and he just struggles, you know, all the time, to um, to master this game.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 Yeah,
3 well, same here, I mean, I'm a brown belt in Karate at this point in time.
4 And, uh, And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball
5 Oh my, really!
6 Yeah.
7 You know I,
8 Because it,
9 well, I watch my husband swing
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 and his swing, you know, like compared to the pros, is so, it's ridged.
2 It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement. You know.
3 Right.
4 That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right,
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.
8 oh yeah.
9 And I worry about that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,
3 I have got to hit it.
4 Yeah.
5 So.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah.
8 I have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second, or, or just keeping my arm wrong.
9 Yep,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 or,
2 Yeah,
3 turning your head is probably the most common thing for women, they say.
4 Is it?
5 And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.
6 Right,
7 exactly.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Exactly,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,
2 I have .
3 It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.
4 Yeah,
5 yeah,
6 I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long you know, than with a driver or something.
7 Oh, driver.
8 Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and you want to see it hit the green.
2 And you know that's why,
3 Watch where it's going.
4 Yeah,
5 so. I I don't know what I'm supposed to ask questions about,
6 That, that is certainly true
7 thank you .
8 am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure,
9 I know that.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 That's okay,
2 go ahead,
3 it's no big deal.
4 Well, uh,  when I,
5 do you get, get, um, reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too?
6 Both.
7 Both.
8 Okay.
9 I believe so.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Okay,
2 well I really did not know  so I,
3 I, I,  I actually don't know,
4 I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out,  until  afterward
5 Yeah.
6 Okay.
7 Cause this is only my second day doing it
8 and I just did not, I did not know
9 and that was .  the details,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh,  really.
2 we, I just started yesterday.
3 I have been doing this for awhile, actually.
4 Have you?
5 It seems like it's been a while.
6 Yeah.
7 And they just,  I just,  get these random checks in the mail every now and then
8 I had a ,
9 and,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I see.
2 My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.
3 I see.
4 And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail
5 and, To be honest, I, I really have not been accounting,
6 Yeah.
7 I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.
8 Uh-huh.
9 You know, if it works, it works.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So ,
2 Well, my, uh,
1 I just pressed my, uh.
2 We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.
3 I got one that's interesting, not too, not too controversial,
4 I,
5 you know, not,
6 doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.
7 I, I do get somewhat of a kick out of,
8 because Schwartzkopf, or the other generals, who I admire, how everyone wants to make, get them in politics.
9 I think that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of recently that, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh-huh.
2 I was wondering what you thought about that making the general, uh, getting a general into politics.
3 Yeah.
4 They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job.
5 Right.
6 Well, I've, I've been thinking about it,
7 and I, uh, I kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero,
8 those,
9 we're looking for a hero.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, TIME magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents,
2 and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.
3 Uh-huh.
4 They are much more educated than the average corporate president,
5 and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a, a very much better education than the average, uh, corporate president.
6 So, I thought well, maybe.
7 I, I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.
8 Well, that, too,
9 that, too.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, uh, you know, they talk about the Army
2 and because of the war
3 and why did we win, and all that,
4 and they talked about how the training was so important.
5 And that's so important in industry,
6 so, you know, they're liable to be right. That generals, generals in the service,
7 and Schwartzkopf, uh, you know, might make a good, uh, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.
8 He, he, you know, we know he's a good leader,
9 we know he's a good organizer.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 The question is, you know, can he be the man who's ultimately responsible.
2 You know, like what he said is, you know, a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about, you know, people asking why are you doing this, why are you doing that.
3 He says, I'm following the orders of my president.
4 I'm not the one who writes the orders.
5 I'm just the one who follows them.
6 Yeah,
7 it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs, you know,
8 everyone has a boss, of course.
9 You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yeah.
2 And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.
3 But he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait.
4 No,
5 that's true,
6 that's true.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh, you, you pick one.
9 I just thought of that one when, when they brought up about politics.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 That was, uh, pretty easy
2 Yeah.
3 you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican,
4 you can pick anything you want,
5 go ahead.
6 Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.
7 How do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long,
8 how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again.
9 Well, I have an easy answer for that, oh, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Yeah.
2 You know, whether that's two five year terms or whatever.
3 I
4 yeah.
5 Yeah.
6 That may be our only answer,
7 but I don't really like it.
8 I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve.
9 Oh, you know, you're not.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat,
2 I think if the President can prove that he's popular, you know, that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want.
3 Yeah.
4 I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.
5 I mean, how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year, did they get after they were elected, just, you know, just after they were elected two years ago.
6 Yeah.
7 Basically the people,
8 as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, Yeah, yeah, you're my friend,
9 you're my friend,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 and two years later he remembers that.
2 And what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years.
3 Yeah,
4 I don't know,
5 I do like the limitation of the President,
6 and I think there is a needed change.
7 I think the same thing should happen for Congress.
8 I, I'd you know,
9 that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 well.
3 My God, it's ridiculous, you know.
4 That's, that's the easy way.
5 I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground
6 We had.
7 That's what the financing rules and the, uh, the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff.
8 I think voting is, is a I think I had one of the subject about voting, and, uh, voting apathy, or something like that,
9 and I think that, uh, the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.
2 Yeah.
3 Of course they have absentee which is getting to be more, a lot easier,
4 and I, I vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now.
5 But, I think, gee whiz, you could make it a couple days.
6 It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days.
7 Yeah.
8 Well, I think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 yeah.
2 You know, like, you know, the, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.
3 Are you in Dallas?
4 Yeah,
5 I'm in Dallas city limit.
6 Boy, I, I, I live in Arlington.
7 I am so happy not to be part of Dallas when I see those folks there.
8 Yeah.
9 It's an ugly mess.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I mean, I don't know if you like the mayor,
2 but I think your mayor,
3 the city council,
4 the,
5 what is the woman's name whose, us, not the mayor but the, *typo should be who's
6 The manager.
7 Yeah,
8 the city manager.
9 All of them need to be thrown out.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean, they're just awful, just awful.
2 Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.
3 Uh-huh
4 And if it, if it had passed,
5 if these people had gotten out the vote, it would have passed
6 and there'd be no more argument.
7 But they're still fighting about it because of the way the election went last December.
8 I know.
9 It's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money. That we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.
2 Uh-huh,
3 yeah.
4 I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.
5 But, but this is for, supposedly to benefit the minorities,
6 and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote
7 Well you're right there.
8 and they would have had their way.
9 You're right there.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh, uh, people are,
2 uh, uh, politics, uh,
3 the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.
4 Yeah,
5 it's pretty sad.
6 Yeah,
7 it is.
8 Uh, hopefully people will get more involved.
9 My, my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Oh, yeah,
2 but those are the ones that are complaining, I, I think, a lot.
3 I see it here at T I.
4 The guys that don't take any interest in, and, and constantly on the negative of everything.
5 Uh-huh.
6 And, uh, Is that right? Ooh.
7 And, and you ask them why they don't vote,
8 they say well they don't want their name on the, uh, jury duty list.
9 That, that's where they get the jury duty list, is from the voter registration.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right,
2 you're right,
3 you're right.
4 I think they could do more about, uh, voting.
5 I think they could.
6 What are the issues?
7 I, I'm a Democrat,
8 I want to just say that I'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat.
9 I don't even know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.
2 Uh-huh.
3 You know, I mean, at least I'd like to see
4 because I like competition, you know.
5 Yeah.
6 I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead,
7 I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party,
8 I can not believe it, you know. *typo cannot
9 In Presidential races that's about what they've done,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things.
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 but I still think in the last ten years,
5 you know, of course that's not a recent event,
6 that's only my opinion,
7 I guess I really shouldn't talk about that.
8 But, I don't know whether they're recent events.
9 I guess they on this, uh, speech thing, they want us to use a variety of words.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Right.
2 How many times have you called, by the way?
3 Actually, I haven't made any calls,
4 but I received about a dozen.
5 Oh, really, I, I, I,
6 I think, yeah, I have to make these,
7 but I get distracted and get to do something else,
8 and all of a sudden my phone rings,
9 and go, Well, what the heck, we'll talk for a while.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Yeah,
2 I've already got twelve cards.
3 You get any cards in the mail?
4 Yeah,
5 we got a whole bunch.
6 I can't remember how many.
7 I don't know,
8 I'm amazed by,
9 of course, we're not talking about politics,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 but I am amazed by,
2 people say they got thirty.
3 Well, I wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice,
4 but I'm not in voice synthesis.
5 But I'd sure like to see a summary of it.
6 We'll get to politics, I'm sorry
7 Well, I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway.
1 Jeri?
2 Yes.
3 We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.
4 That's a rather, rather broad topic
5 They're usually pretty broad anyway.
6 Yeah.
7 Where do you live?
8 Uh, we live in Plano.
9 Okay,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 so, that's a,
2 Uh, and where you are?
3 I'm in Richardson,
4 so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, uh, Maceo High School in Dallas.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Right.
7 Right,
8 that is so frightening.
9 It is, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Uh, do you have children in school?
2 No,
3 mine are already in college now,
4 so I don't have to,
5 Yeah.
6 at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.
7 Well, I have,
8 my oldest is his first year in high school
9 so we have all this to, to look forward to,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and it is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.
2 I mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,
3 but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening.
4 That's true.
5 And, uh, I really, you know,
6 they're coming down on the principal,
7 but I really don't know what they can do.
8 I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence
9 and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.
2 Yeah,
3 well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.
4 Well I don't either,
5 but apparently they just really are.
6 Uh I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get for for being in a, a large area.
7 But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about having guns
8 and uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.
9 Oh, my heavens.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 And, I mean, it just scared me to death
2 and, you know, they called the police
3 and, and nothing happened,
4 but my goodness you know, it, it could have easily.
5 Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.
6 Maybe so.
7 You know, because I don't,
8 now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,
9 and people don't do anything.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Yeah.
2 A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now.
3 And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.
4 Oh, no.
5 But nobody, nobody did anything.
6 I just can't imagine that.
7 You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.
8 Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm afraid, you know, if you,
2 I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.
3 Right,
4 well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,
5 but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.
6 Yeah.
7 I,
8 I just, you know,
9 it's, it's really frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.
2 Right.
3 Well I, I think you're right there.
4 I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,
5 but I think that's real dangerous
6 and, uh, I don't know.
7 I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, you know
8 and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But, uh,
2 Yeah,
3 well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just,
4 I don't know,
5 people just don't,
6 I don't know,
7 I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.
8 Yeah.
9 But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, maybe this thing with with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to, to correct it.
2 I don't know,
3 it's, it really is, is frightening.
4 Yeah
5 I, uh,
1 So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,
2 so.
3 Right.
4 Um, well, what do you think is, uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air?
5 I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just, uh, I think they put off so much
6 and they're not regulated enough.
7 Yeah,
8 well , that's me too.
9 After, um,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,
2 and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,
3 but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people
4 Uh-huh.
5 and, and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,
6 Yeah.
7 and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution
8 and, you know, their their regulation that's placed on them is, I mean, it's better than it used to be
9 but it's incredible that they still don't have, you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 You know, I, I just,
3 I can't stand that
4 and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,
5 you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a, we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a plant, uh, a Pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours,
6 Uh-huh.
7 and I know people that work there that,
8 of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,
9 No.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do, uh, to, uh, make their dough and to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,
2 Really?
3 yeah,
4 Huh.
5 I mean, it's incredible.
6 And, um, they said that they're, you know, they have a little creek that runs by them
7 and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything
8 and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping,
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,
2 Right.
3 that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant
4 I can't imagine plants,
5 I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even had you know, well,
6 those chemicals would not,
7 Yeah,
8 they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to, to break the flours down
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and then they, they also do testing there,
2 and I don't,
3 you know, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive
4 but toxic can be, can be anything that's uh, classified that can damage the Earth.
5 Right,
6 yeah.
7 So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, uh, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.
8 Right,
9 you know, like in, In packaging
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 and, uh, you know, just goodness.
3 Yeah,
4 I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,
5 Yeah.
6 but they do, they do a lot of research
7 and they do, um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there
8 or,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm not really,
2 what's it called when you do flour,
3 I'm not,
4 Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching
5 but, I mean, I, I don't know what's, how they do the flour.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah.
8 But, um, we, we're on the southwest side of Houston
9 we don't have that much as far as, uh, aiming in the plants over on this, uh, the east side does.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Uh-huh.
2 We've got Imperial sugar
3 but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also
4 and, uh, they've been there for years.
5 Yeah.
6 And, uh,
7 But,
8 I mean, you think about it, it, you know,
9 it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I'm not really sure
2 but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,
3 Yeah.
4 or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,
5 Uh-huh.
6 but when they pollute into the air and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.
7 So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the
8 unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends to get stuck there,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air, you know, per, per, uh, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away,
2 Right,
3 yeah.
4 Uh-huh.
5 but, um,
6 I know that,
7 I worry every now and then,
8 we're still on a well water,
9 we're not on city water,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
