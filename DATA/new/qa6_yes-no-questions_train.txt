2 Well I I oh I n't know .
3 It 's kind tricky question I think 's 's practical system
4 obviously 's compatible know tens
5 things make sense .
6 Um 's 's switch .
7 The problem would switch .
8 I think I think
9 I mean I n't know happened last time .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I remember tried seventies one point something
2 That 's I elementary school years
3 We learned metric
4 I n't quite know failed .
5 Um I would bet push I I bet push n't big enough .
6 You know n't sort encourage I mean businesses things use
7 know I think 'd would things start phasing things
8 So I think 's first metric
9 I mean 's things 've gone metric .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 We metric cola
2 I thinking two liter bottles buy one liter bottles .
3 You n't buy quarts gallons anymore soda .
4 So know little things metric
5 one talks know uh
6 buy nine twelve frames
7 n't buy centimeter length frames cooking pans .
8 And even though car says miles kilometers
9 I went hundred kilometers . You know .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 fifty-nine kilometers per gallon .
2 I would I would total loss .
3 I think I think though know sort government incentive program something people would begin switch know
4 I think would hard core older people would get really pissed
5 pardon expression uh would get really know upset start complain get cranky stuff .
6 But I think end would make life lot easier people coming .
7 really would .
8 It 's I I 's I think good try started us elementary schools trying know get minds could I mean
9 I think generation could make change .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 It would difficult
2 would difficult people say fifty years old never exposed metric system know buying two liter Coke .
3 Well I think I think difference might might first generation elementary school .
4 let 's say imagine kept going
5 'd know two three generations familiar metric system .
6 Not like could use comfortably right
7 I could convert know
8 I could carry around little conversion card something
9 I could handle eventually I 'd learn
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think know bunch little kids using .
2 And I think enough people
3 know sort get older I think others bring generations eventually 'll able make switch
4 're going start going crazy yelling saying crazy ca n't understand .
5 We 'll say oh 's pain neck
6 'll sort deal I think .
7 That 's true .
8 That makes sense .
9 I n't know .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I I I would hope would uh
2 seems like 's reasonable system .
3 I mean everything seems based thing .
4 Well I trying think kind things 'd change
5 'd change height driver 's license .
6 When would n't five foot eight anymore uh 'd hundred seventy centimeters
7 'd lighter kilograms pounds .
8 But I wonder
9 So dieters would happy
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I weigh sixteen today .
2 But I wonder 's even something know change immediately .
3 They could know sort phase
4 like licenses would rather going back changing everything know new licenses nineteen ninety-two would something .
5 And 'd change little ruler 's door seven eleven tells tall robbers hold .
6 That 's right .
7 I know though uh amusement parks say 're forty-two inches something . You ca n't walk .

9 see like know say 're taller line .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 line seventy-three centimeters .
2 That 's right .
3 Just 'll know
4 It would neat case like kids taught parents I think know .
5 Because n't pretty much everywhere world ?
6 I know England metric .
7 But I n't know .
8 I I n't think um measurements started England
9 I think 're part continent n't changed metric .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 virtually rest world .
2 I mean seems like like like like sort stupid .
3 I mean course Americans
4 're supposed know
5 We 're trend setters world .
6 I n't know We n't changed sensible system .
7 That 's right
8 're backwards .
9 I n't know .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9

10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 's know tuna radioactive certain extent .
2 That 's right .
3 Everything eat .
4 Everything everything eat label
1 um I wondering whether favor statehood independence status quo Puerto Rico .
2 I resident although young state Alaska nineteen fifty-nine Alaska stopped territory became state .
3 Uh I guess I left positive feeling question even though I n't know much Puerto Rico .
4 Uh I know things happened relative territory Alaska positive uh
5 I suspicion I believe statehood good idea whenever territory size Puerto Rico one ought either make full-fledged state let go one .
6 What situation ?
7 Well I 'm I guess I n't close experience um area becoming state .
8 Um concern economy I understand Puerto Rico low uh standard living least um annual average income .
9 Um part I suppose justified climate n't need perhaps heating housing northern territories need .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 However case I guess I would favor status quo .
2 I Puerto Rico found interesting .
3 I Peace Corps training .
4 Oh 's interesting .
5 And um know I saw also young student
6 foreign certain sense although I grown California
7 Spanish problem .
8 Um know lovely
9 people seemed friendly nice .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 actually I work uh girl Puerto Rico
2 I guess I never thought ask favors um .
3 Your concern economy one terms became state would put even pressures Puerto Rico pressures U. S. terms aid
4 Well probably terms U. S. Um
5 know I 'm I 'm quite sure U. S. copes sort thing .
6 I 've live abroad life
7 I guess I I 've cut .
8 I lived actually Lebanon
9 I cut press I know becoming adult .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 So I n't know U. S. would cope uh new state poor .
2 Um I guess know 'd lot aid consider inner cities like New York much aid needs .
3 I suppose whole country whole um new state would require aid .
4 I guess um 're assuming Puerto Rico would per capita significantly poor perhaps say Mississippi
5 I think .
6 's something I guess I much image Puerto Rico tropical island consequently large numbers barefoot natives something perjuritive sense carefree sense I guess .
7 Although I 'm aware political problems unrest also difficulties . Um I n't know whether state statehood would improve economy .
8 I n't I n't know act state would impact .
9 Uh I guess would ability taxing n't .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 But course economy weak much base tax .
2 I n't know suffer sense income loss since n't state whether monies escape speak n't able tax like typical state would .
3 How feel though
4 well I guess 's advantage territory
5 um I wonder territory young student
6 parents military time
7 n't ready negative feelings Alaska time since voted absentee .
8 I I would imagine must little bit feeling second class citizenry uh territory large able vote .
9 The District Columbia people instance quite frustrated I think times Senate representative .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 good points um obviously I never thought .
2 Uh I n't know uh I suppose also state probably freer determine um ways life would
3 I 'm trying think exactly imposed would become state versus territory .
4 Uh I see mean
5 taxes would undoubtedly occurring .
6 I n't know I n't even understand exactly taxes handled territorial situation .
7 Um frequently laws territory ways stringent states
8 I 'm thinking terms education .
9 But state sets
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I n't know territorial governor takes care something like Puerto Rico .
2 Um 's interesting I n't thought terms problems relative uh economy uh I thought terms political uh realization
3 I guess I automatically made assumption gee anyone would rather state U. S. independent country
4 Well well actually I
5 one one thing I remember hearing news past couple weeks might significant 've recently voted Spanish official language I always assumed anyway .
6 So 've taken action would seem indicate either 're 're afraid might become state want declare become state maybe n't want become state fear losing Spanish Hispanic heritage .
7 well 's interesting .
8 Well sounds though favor uh status quo .
9 I I believe I would probably tend towards .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 And I think uh listened relative economy thing I think I forced make decision I would plead ignorance wait research picking one .
2 So I 'm I guess I 'm ultimately favor status quo also point leaning towards statehood .
3 Well 's interesting .
4 What um demanded Spanish official language condition statehood .
5 I think I would troubled
6 I suspect I believe states
7 constitutionally I n't think prescriptions decision even Louisiana chose go Creole something .
8 Um I n't think prohibitions .
9 I would bothered .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I 'm I 'm bothered tendency resist I think one America 's strengths
2 's melting pot .
3 Uh I I particularly fond number ethnic cuisines
4 I 'm troubled close clinging past
5 I 'm also realizing common language I think ultimate bond country .
6 And Canada I guess comes mind 're going throes relative French Quebec whatever .
7 Uh I I think would negative step make
8 I think would need reassess .
9 Um I 'm troubled even bilingualism uh far gets way melting pot aspect .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That 's interesting although I tend bilingual Spanish based experience um I bilingual education California
2 I n't problem students
3 I noticed brother quite bit younger learning Spanish elementary school
4 ca n't speak word .
5 And obviously n't work California .
6 I 'm rather favor people bilingual
7 I 'd quite happy see national law every student required learn English second language .
8 But I 'm I 'm disturbed country attempts functionally bilingual official level .
9 Oh I see .

10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Do pay .
2 You get fitness membership allows use facilities
3 's eight dollars month .
4 Oh 's bad .
5 Pretty cheap .
1 Well uh think metric system ?
2 Uh uh find useable ?
3 Have tried much ?
4 Well engineering degree 's course 's whole lot easier .
5 To use mean
6 somebody totally unfamiliar uh human nature n't like change .
7 Uh absolutely makes perfectly good sense 's decimal .
8 And 's easy convert one set units another .
9 well I 've lived United States country use metric system
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 uh I 've I 've lived pounds inches found really quite easy convert .
2 Um secret seeming bother ever converting inches centimeters pounds uh uh kilograms
3 That 's right .
4 I think 's hung people went wait minute inch two point fifty-four centimeters
5 earth I every going math ? *spelling
6 And problem tried convert everything inches centimeters preserving basically inches expressing centimeters rather saying centimeter width thumbnail whatever know leaving
7 uh know kilogram weighs much
8 get used scratch
9 cause I still ca n't convert back forth inches centimeters
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I 'm perfectly comfortable using either .
2 And I think real problem weird conversion see signs say fifty-five miles per hour know whatever would one hundred six kilometers per hour know
3 's hard take seriously .
4 Oh yeah .
5 And long given basically n't read kilometers per hour
6 say well look read miles per hour one
7 one must someone else .
8 That 's right .
9 Uh I n't know
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean even Britain converted
2 That 's right
3 's fault .
4 Well I mean 's fault point saw light um
5 I n't know um able
6 except I think probably said well 're going start using things
7 sort force people change since n't want
8 Of course part European community everybody else probably much
9 much necessary us .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That 's true
2 's 's probably true
3 America long history sort things way rather adopting know model .
4 There 's expression
5 With eyes past backing confidently future .
6 I 've never heard one
7 Oh I 'm metric system converting
8 I guess feeling way start giving weights know brief transition period start giving weights kilometers er kilometers weights kilograms everything like uh people start using rather people constantly trying convert .
9 Remember getting package something said one pound
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 package dates mind
2 's presumably something weigh fairly precisely
3 said one pound
4 parenthesis said four hundred fifty-four point six grams
5 And near I could tell seeing basically anti-metric propaganda
6 cause anyone would say well look I either buy pound something four hundred sixty-four point six grams course could n't weigh accurately anyway um
7 every time I see something like I think well 's 's anti-metric argument .
8 Well uh I I n't think 'll could ever happen quick transition .
9 You n't ?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I I think would easiest way
2 human nature I would think would take probably two three years people could completely cut cord .
3 oh oh 's I thinking quick transition
4 I n't mean know I n't mean like Sweden going right hand drive anything know
5 midnight tonight switch anything .
6 Did switch ?
7 Uh I believe
8 I think overnight
9 cause know ca n't gradually .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 That 's example something ca n't gradually .
2 Well 's true .
3 It kind discreet transaction
4 A quantum leap left right hand drive
5 know must taken uh
6 something done quickly know external circumstances
7 Oh yes .
8 decided make sync rest Europe rest continental Europe
9 know . But must tremendously difficult orchestrate .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I 'm sure .
2 Um I I I I I think 's essential 's done
3 I think real trick avoid know
4 little attention human psychology
5 whereas people want round numbers
6 whole reason go metric round numbers n't deal thirty seconds inch
7 thing best metric thing poorly represented .
8 Really I think .
9 Well two liter soda pop bottles .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I saw day .
2 I n't drink soda pop
3 I saw two liter soda pop bottle
4 things like good start

6 That 's true .
1 think space budget
2 go ahead keep exploring
3 I think space program done lot good country .
4 Now I think made major wrong turn went uh current generation space craft reusable ones like proven reliable
5 I think earlier approaches much uh much better many ways .
6 However uh know 've gained awful lot space program way remote monitoring teflon uh new space age materials plastics .
7 So I think 's good investment .

9 I 've heard 's really well I mean 's coming idea Bible 's true .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 That 's uh
2 could interpret way .
3 Uh I I think trying say great deal historical truth
4 interpretation actually got writing Bible probably uh uh King James Version committee wrote translation much lost translation particularly since translations Greek .
5 Well example . In Greek seven different words love .
6 's one word love brother one word love wife one word know uh love father sort thing .
7 So types interpretations uh really made difference one might interpret Bible 's .
8 So 's know
9 look though saying 's true
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 's much historical fact involved uh histories developed around time available . To deny least majority true .
2 So know depends look .
3 You look know

6 well Well interpret T V show way interpret Bible .

8 's right .
9 But uh I n't know time limit uh .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 uh I I 'm familiar .
2 I think uh guys Indiana n't death penalty ?
3 death penalty .
4 It 's exercised often
5 I know 's lot lot problems
6 uh seems crimes heinous person I feel n't deserve live n't deserve tax payers spend however many thousands dollars costs year keep prison life .
7 But I know 's lot problems like well say okay declare someone put death row execute well ten years later find really n't life wasted
8 seems like cases 's 's good policy .
9 Uh I I tend agree
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 uh I 've changed views uh even within last years uh honest .
2 Uh uh I I undergraduate I member Amnesty International
3 uh course time know I thought uh uh stupid kill anybody uh
4 eye eye stupid argument .
5 I live downtown Dallas
6 I uh know I 've seen uh I 've seen cases news know uh person murdered person back street commits another murder .
7 I think maybe uh good solution capital punishment might uh reserve solely uh repeat offenders crime like uh murder .
8 That 's 's thought I never really seems pretty sensible .
9 seems sensible failsafe .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I I uh I n't
2 know completely failsafe
3 man 's convicted two murders uh know 's pretty good chance something 's wrong .
4 Uh I also uh
5 tell liberal I turned uh toward whatever side I 've kind chosen uh I believe uh big time drug importers like uh say Noriega example people need uh eliminated uh society
6 I think I think death penalty best choice people uh really kind uh uh jail sentence another chance uh create another power structure
7 're 're right .
8 basically views I guess tend economically oriented I know come figures costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars year keep someone alive jail 're going life 're never going rehabilitated .
9 I mean I n't believe prison system today much towards rehabilitation begin
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 I 'm paying taxes know twenty percent check whatever keep somebody alive I mind n't first place never going valuable worthwhile part society
2 I I 'm favor .
3 Well uh uh
4 cases think uh capital capital punishment n't uh uh sentenced ?
5 Well I I really n't know question .
6 It seems like
7 instance Jeffrey Dahlmer case . I mean I n't really think person going ever worthwhile part society .
8 I hope guy never gets back streets
9 case Wisconsin n't death penalty
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 's going sentenced life imprisonment
2 I think allowed live
3 know 're kind playing God never good thing .
4 That 's true
5 But cases I think death penalty withheld uh really I think .
6 I I would I would favor death penalty things like know murders like said repeat murders serial killers
7 uh I n't really agree uh death penalty people like Noriega .
8 I think 're 're operating
9 I mean I know 're causing massive problems society
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I n't really think 's 's power take people sovereign state say n't deserve live 're feeding consumer needs .
2 I understand I understand point .
3 Uh course know uh Dahlmer uh realize I think 's Ohio uh gets try next
4 death penalty .
1 want start first

3 I like large colleges I went University Texas Austin
4 fifty thousand students .
5 And I feel like I went I gone small college couple thousand I would n't gotten much exposure different people different uh I n't know different languages different cultures things like around fifty thousand students .
6 That 's interesting
7 I went smaller school probably three thousand thirty-five hundred .
8 And I I thought best experience one-on-one since seemed know everyone campus
9 broad spectrum languages cultures backgrounds forth
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I thought wonderful bigger fish much number
2 um one fifty thousand I one three thousand know different perspectives
3 sounds like kind looking sort sort thing .
4 I I could see I could see point I could see would .
5 I 'm sure classes lot smaller um like would biology classes main courses everyone take I mean hundreds students class
6 actually yes number .
7 But um I I
8 I n't know
9 I 'm thinking sense uh exposed .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 It seems like larger college I n't know exposed many people world
2 I 'm sure lot people come know small colleges also 're different cultures
3 's 's better
4 I 'm saying I think big
5 That 's one thing definitely consider .
6 I think uh lot lot students would probably afraid smaller college
7 lot students I talked even Waco go Baylor um
8 're considering going Baylor
9 're also considering going U T Austin
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 one big no-nos fifty thousand students
2 I tell like like I live Waco
3 's large city
4 I still function kind area group .
5 I 'm really concerned entire city go big big university 're concerned entire university group friends classes interests clubs things like .
6 I think 's probably keyed much size school particular needs students
7 whereas would immediately feel comfortable um larger university setting students um I I teaching school would comfortable .
8 They needed uh least first needed smaller setting like family could get one-on-one teachers professors forth year two move little bit bigger pond little self-confidence built oh yes I oh I 've done 's bigger setting
9 maybe key would students needs
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 's things I keying really education

6 But given full honor work uh oh gosh I ca n't think word accept 's responsible .
7 Uh responsibilities I trying say .
8 Oh I n't think .
9 I think come long ways terms giving equal opportunities
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I still think lots job markets treated equals .
2 In words respects direction job markets n't really want treated equals .
3 By token cases women jobs responsibility men lower salaries .
4 I think 's generally speaking pretty true .
5 Is right wrong ?
6 And I think 's really ought look going going equal work ought get equal pay .
7 And uh ought equal opportunities advance positions
8 I n't think gotten yet .
9 Well changes think significant past years ?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Any individual thing
2 Oh boy .
3 general switch ?
4 I think 's generally switch .
5 And I think switch work force .
6 I n't think women treated equals home much work force .
7 I think women working probably still expected carry responsibility home husband side coin picked much responsibility home .
8 So one three quarters jobs . Whereas husbands one quarter .
9 upsets man always built think sort head household .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So think going uh difficult saying far marriages people enjoying future years ?

4 I think opportunity definitely um people invade privacy want
5 I think 's um
6 In manner ?
7 Well 's certainly difficult tap phone .
8 It 's completely trivial instance listen someone 's car phone walk around phone since 're radio signals .
9 It 's um
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 let 's see
2 well 's first thing comes mind ?

4 reality many cases knew information purchased organizations .
5 And I thought uh beginning invade privacy people things live maybe purchased past months put sent someone else business
6 return come back try sell something additional knowledge .
7 To 's invasion privacy .
8 I agree sure .
9 Um I think information quite easy anyone get .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9

4 Well um .
5 well instance yes um
6 'll probably goes things like know records government utility companies anything .

9 I think potential becoming serious problems .
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 could done think correct ?
2 Um I 'm really sure I mean society going electronic
3 's hard hard say whether um risks potential outweighing benefits
4 I 'm sure done ensure n't .
5 see us ?
6 Well I would think uh information held records uh company charge card dealer person absolutely private allowed uh given companies .
7 I mean made uh national state law protect people uh would feel free deal direct companies .
8 In words call company directly uh know tell records available anyone else uh know outside speak would would feel free uh go detail

9 uh maybe would better let Panamanians run however I think 're certainly justified uh actions dealing uh Noriega ...
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Well think Panama Canal considerable strategic importance particularly military .
2 Interestingly enough father World War One uh civil engineer offered commission captain would uh go uh help defenses Panama Canal .
3 He worked United Fruit Company

10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 I I n't
2 I 've Salvador
3 uh fact went back visit friends fathers went fifty-seven I guess .
4 And interestingly enough canal quite small realistically could sabotaged quite quite easily .
5 The thing I find interesting though uh whole colonial approach
6 support Sandinistas support uh

8 ever studied political makeup Nicaragua .
9 I little bit
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5

6 economic ties .
7 's economic interest United States uh go prevail
8 uh words make world safe democracy
9 's economic benefit
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think particularly 're 're looking peasant uh whether 's Central America regardless life life better communism uh Democratic government .
2 You look Salvador
3 Well n't care long 's feeding uh family .
4 question government make difference .
5 If 'll mostly leave alone uh
6 I think 's difficulty uh reality n't make uh n't make difference income .
7 And apparently even alleged uh Central American leaders uh mostly democratic done pretty terrible things
8 look region uh
9 detriment came uh uh hundreds years Spanish control
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 Spaniards uh horrible history corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers uh manipulating manipulating public good .
2 I mean go back kings conquistadors coming incredibly horrible things uh native tribes

3 's 's America 's role
4 things going seems lessened
5 've still got uh Cuba accepts exerts influence .
6 The thing I see Cuba though uh Fidel Castro dies I n't think 'll communist power anymore .
7 I I ca n't see communism country carrying past .
8 Well take situation I think particular Salvador significant class excuse
9 know lot difficulty uh surviving uh question would know would better communism .
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I would n't n't know I would advocate communism
2 uh question uh uh democracy uh afford
3 's like street people starting show U S 's essentially underclass
4 get enough uh know communism would feed .
5 well I I n't know maybe communism right right word
6 may point 've uh might want consider kind socialistic uh organization socialistic set deal problem able gradually transform back democracy .
7 guys got incentive
8 's got uh
9 know raise enough uh coffee bananas uh 's got something protect
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
