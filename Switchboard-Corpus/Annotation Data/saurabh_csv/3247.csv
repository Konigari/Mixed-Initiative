B,Correct.,,,
B,"Okay,",,,
B,"well, I'm for it.",,,
B,"I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.",,,
B,"I, I feel like that child molestation and murder",,,
B,I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.,,,
B,"I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,",,,

A,"Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,

A,"but, but yes,",,,
A,prisons are overcrowded.,,,
B,"I know that we have, you know,",,,
B,"really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,",,,
B,"and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,",,,
B,"and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,",,,
B,"and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,",,,
B,"and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it",,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.",,,
A,"Okay,",,,
A,"you're, you're certainly in the majority uh, at least in this country.",,,

A,"but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.",,,
B,"Yes,",,,
B,"you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.",,,
A,"Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,",,,
A,"arguably, if",,,
A,"arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.",,,
A,"Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.",,,
B,"Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?",,,
A,"Yes,",,,
A,"oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.",,,
A,"I, I, I,",,,
A,however the question is is that making the difference.,,,
B,"Oh, I, I don't know.",,,
B,But we have a lot of welfare programs,,,
B,and,,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,",,,
B,"you know, or is it,",,,
B,"in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.",,,
A,"Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.",,,
B,"Oh, do you?",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Well, that's interesting.",,,
B,"I would not have, I would not have said that.",,,
