B,"and she would, she would quilt whole quilts by herself.",,,
A,"Oh, my God.",,,
B,"Um, yes,",,,
B,"which,",,,
B,I was always amazed.,,,
B,"I have one of them. Um,",,,
B,"but, uh, you know, to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that, it's a tremendous amount of work.",,,
A,"Well, I haven't done tons of them",,,
A,"But, um, I used to do more before, um, before I had, before we got our baby,",,,
A,but.,,,
B,"Oh, you think, children,",,,

B,"I think afghans and, and the crocheted little sweaters, and, are, are wonderful.",,,
B,"And, and they'll wear them",,,
A,"Yes,",,,
A,exactly.,,,
B,Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them,,,
A,"Well, one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then, um, cut out a little pattern from the material, from some material, like flowers or something, and make, um, a design or, you know, a little arrangement or something on the shirt and, you know, fuse it on with Heat and Bond, or whatever and then paint around it.",,,
A,"And I usually sew, sew around the flower, whatever first,",,,
A,and then I paint around it,,,
A,so you can't see the stitching as much.,,,
A,"Does, does that make sense to you?",,,
A,So.,,,
B,"Oh, yes,",,,
B,I think it's very clever.,,,
B,"It's, uh, funny that you said.",,,
B,"For Christmas, my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us. A beautiful Christmas design,",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,and they were matching,,,
B,"and they were lovely,",,,
B,"but when I washed them, although I took the precaution of turning them inside out I really didn't do anything else. And truly, everything fell off, or most of it.",,,
A,"Oh, sure.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Oh, really.",,,
B,"So I had, I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back",,,
B,and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges,,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"and, and it was salvageable",,,
B,"and I,",,,
B,"but it's,",,,
B,"so I'm familiar with that,",,,
B,"but I think you're very clever to, um, sew around the edges.",,,
B,"I think gluing alone, certainly if you wash it any amount of time, it tends to kind of come loose at the edges.",,,
A,Well.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"someone told me that, that it, that they had done it both ways,",,,
A,"and I've always, after hearing that, I always sewed it on, even, even with the, uh, a loose zigzag even helps",,,
A,"And, um,",,,
