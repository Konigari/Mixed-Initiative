A,Surprised they get anybody this time of day,,,
A,"but, I've been trying all different times,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"but I don't get  anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night",,,
A,"so thought,  I'll try ,",,,
B,"Oh, well, I'm at,  work",,,
B,and I just happened to walk back into my office.,,,
A,Oh,,,
B,I've been  gone for a little while,,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,"Well, I go to school",,,
A,"so I'm home certain days,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and, uh,  I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you?",,,
A,"Got,",,,

B,I haven't here lately.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"It's, it's, uh,",,,
A,"well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,I never  had to make one.,,,
A,They just always came,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Exactly.,,,
A,People must be tired of it or something.,,,
A,"well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject,",,,
A,what do you think?,,,
B,"Well, I never gave it any thought myself",,,
B,I was hoping you could tell me what you thought.,,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,"Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that.",,,
A,I think it might be good for them.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,But  as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent.,,,
B,Exactly.,,,
A,I'm  just concerned about their safety,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,because  if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto,,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,uh-huh.,,,
A,"And if they were  sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"That,  that would be my main objection. I don't think,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I don't know,,,
B,"I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis",,,
A,it will probably never happen,,,
A,"but,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that",,,
B,"but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"well it, it probably won't.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I don't,  I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway.",,,
A,"We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,That's another consideration,,,
B,Exactly,,,
A,"But, uh, I don't know",,,
A,some kids are so spoiled nowadays,,,
A,"it might be a real eye opener, you know",,,
B,Really,,,
A,"I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here",,,
A,and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes,,,
A,"and then they think,",,,
A,"they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl,,,
B,I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that  for a while,,,
A,Oh,,,
A,"Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?",,,
B,Wouldn't it though?,,,
A,I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country.,,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,it is.,,,
A,I know.,,,
A,"Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world,  and  helping some countries I never even heard of.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I know it.,,,
A,"It seems to me we are,",,,
A,it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders.,,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"But, what do I know, right?",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I don't get too many.,,,
A,And I can never find  anybody.,,,
B,Huh.,,,
A,"So, um,",,,
B,The first time I used to get calls from far away too.,,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"Like Maryland,  and  New Jersey,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I've had the same experiences,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,all  right around here.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I don't know, uh,",,,
A,"I wonder if they really,",,,
A,I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents.,,,
A,"There's just, there's so many with this one town you know.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,even in some families some people talk a little bit different.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,My husband is  from New Jersey,,,
A,and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me,,,
A,"and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way,",,,
A,"and that's one family, right?",,,
A,"Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny",,,
A,but,,,
B,"Oh, I agree.",,,
A,"You know, how that goes",,,
