A,"So I'll, I'll bicycle",,,
A,"I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,",,,

A,"But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,",,,
