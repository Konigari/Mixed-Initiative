B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"did you ever see, um, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?",,,

B,"I can't put it exactly on the lines of the JAGGED EDGE,",,,
A,"Uh-huh,",,,
A,yeah.,,,
B,you get these twists,,,
B,"and, it's usually pretty good,",,,
B,"but, uh.",,,
A,"I think, I think though, that movies are losing their luster.",,,
B,What's that?,,,
A,"I think movies are losing their attractiveness, just to a lot of people.",,,
A,"Just,",,,
A,"I think,",,,
A,"I don't know,",,,
A,because of the cost,,,
A,"and, I think it, it's just losing its originality or something.",,,
A,"I don't,",,,
A,"I can't pin, pinpoint it.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah,,,
A,"But it doesn't seem like it's as big, uh, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be.",,,
B,That's probably true.,,,
B,"I, I, I",,,
B,"just you see the same story lines, different characters",,,

A,"yeah,",,,
A,exactly.,,,
B,"it's, it's, it's hard to say.",,,
B,"An,",,,
B,"and I know I don't,",,,
B,"you, know, I don't keep up with it, you know.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"But, uh, I don't try to",,,
B,"just for that reason, it is a, it does cost a lot,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"so why go out and see something right away, you know,",,,
B,you kind of wait,,,
B,"and if something gets really good reviews, maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks, you know to go to it.",,,
A,"Right,",,,
A,"right,",,,
A,uh-huh.,,,
B,"But, um, you know, I haven't been to a to an opening for, oh, you know ages, Just because.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
