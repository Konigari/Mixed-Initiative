B,So.,,,

B,"Well you know, well, now I don't know.",,,
B,Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge,,,

B,"so we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that,",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"and,",,,
A,"Well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the Premier Family Cruise Line",,,
A,and then we went to Disney.,,,

A,Yes.,,,
A,That's right.,,,
A,"That's right,",,,
A,"and kids are really cheaper, too.",,,
B,Really.,,,
A,"We really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,",,,
A,"so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available.",,,
A,"So we took whatever was available,",,,
A,"and we left a day early,",,,
A,"and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton,",,,

B,Wow.,,,
A,So we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.,,,
B,Oh what a deal.,,,

A,"So then our cruise was actually extended a day,",,,
A,"and our Disney was extended a day,",,,

A,Yes.,,,
A,"Well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado?",,,
B,"Oh, well, we like to ski, of course,",,,
B,"so we spend so much time with our families uh, and seeing our friends,",,,

B,because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation.",,,
B,"We did, um, last year, though, go to San Antonio for Memorial Day which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Uh, but, you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard to do any, any kind of events that, uh don't, don't require as much,",,,
