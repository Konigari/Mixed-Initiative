B,"We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem.",,,
A,Do you really?,,,

A,"probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns.",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.",,,
B,"Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment,",,,

A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,"it, it becomes, uh,",,,
A,"maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is.",,,
A,"Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be.",,,
B,"Send, send them to Wisconsin,",,,

B,"It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here.",,,
