B,There you go.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials",,,
B,"and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Now my personal opinion,",,,
B,I don't know.,,,
B,"Uh, uh, here lately it seems,",,,
B,"well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh,",,,
B,"they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,It's just not right.,,,
A,I think I agree with that very much.,,,
B,And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.,,,
A,"I,",,,
A,"do you,",,,
A,"Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that,",,,
A,and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?,,,
B,"Yes,",,,
B,very possibly.,,,
B,"So many of us have led sheltered lives that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"I've never done it myself unfortunately,",,,
A,I never have either.,,,
B,I wish I could have.,,,
B,I've just never been called up.,,,
A,"My husband works as a police man,",,,
A,so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.,,,
B,"Well now, that's possible.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once,",,,
B,but I never made it to the jury.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?",,,
B,Not that I know of.,,,
A,"Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury,",,,
A,"and I had never heard of such thing,",,,
A,and I wondered if it was true.,,,
B,Uh-huh,,,
B,"Uh, I've never heard of it.",,,
A,"I never had either,",,,
A,"but I just wondered. Uh,",,,
A,"another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision,",,,
A,"and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.",,,
B,"Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.",,,
A,That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other.,,,
B,Exactly.,,,
B,Is it guilt or innocence.,,,
B,"But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,",,,
B,"and, and it permits the criminal to get a retrial.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,yeah.,,,
B,"And there,",,,
B,"that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence.",,,
A,"Uh-huh,",,,
A,uh-huh.,,,
A,Bring some of these things out.,,,
B,Yes.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.,,,
A,"Un, apparently there are.",,,
A,"I, I, I,",,,
A,"since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.",,,
A,"Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.",,,
B,"Oh, that's it,",,,
B,and you just might resemble somebody.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.",,,
B,"It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"We had,",,,
B,"a Black man was accused simply because he resembled uh, someone who who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was.",,,
A,"Oh. Uh-huh,",,,
A,uh-huh.,,,
B,"And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work,",,,
B,"and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,",,,
A,They still found him guilty?,,,
B,They found him guilty.,,,
A,When people said he was at work?,,,
B,"Well, they said it this, this happened during lunch time.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"But after nine years,",,,
B,"well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.",,,
A,"Oh, for heaven's sake.",,,
A,So there's nine years of that man's life gone.,,,
B,Exactly.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Now that just was not fair.,,,
A,"No,",,,
A,huh-uh.,,,
B,So.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,",,,
A,"we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.",,,
B,Yes.,,,
A,"And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.",,,
B,"Unfortunately, that's what happens.",,,
B,"Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,",,,
B,but it's the best one in the world.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"it's the best one that exists, I guess.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,",,,
B,"and they try to solve them and everything,",,,
B,"but, uh, I don't know,",,,
B,"the Supreme Court,",,,
B,"well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.",,,
A,"Oh, I think a lot of people are.",,,
A,I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.,,,
B,"Well, it,",,,
B,"the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me",,,
B,"no,",,,
B,"I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would.",,,
A,"That bad, huh.",,,
A,"I wouldn't like it,",,,
A,but I don't know if I'd go that far.,,,
B,"Well, I happen to be a flag freak.",,,
B,"I served, I was in the service",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I was in Korea,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.",,,
A,It's important in so many facets of our lives.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"see what they,",,,
A,There's nobody holding them here.,,,
B,See how they'd like it under another flag.,,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"They'd soon be back,",,,
A,I'm sure.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I hope they get something out of this.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's,",,,
A,"do you think that's good you know, like if a jury,",,,
B,Oh,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"but I think the jury should be able to recommend,",,,
A,Make a recommendation?,,,
B,Yes.,,,
A,Do they sometimes make a recommendation?,,,
B,"Oh, yes,",,,
B,yes.,,,
A,"That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.",,,
B,I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.,,,
B,"But I know I'm always hearing that, uh,",,,
B,"well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict",,,
B,"and they recommended,  twenty years or  something.",,,
A,And they recommend.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen. Yeah.,,,
B,Yes.,,,
B,"Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.,,,
A,"Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,",,,
A,"but actually, their chance, course, when,",,,
A,"a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.",,,
A,"It depends on you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole",,,
B,"and,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.,,,
A,And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.,,,
B,Yes.,,,
B,They just go out and repeat their crimes.,,,
A,"Uh-huh,",,,
A,uh-huh.,,,
B,"Well there,",,,
B,"well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,",,,
B,but I think they ought to make it two offenses.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I always thought there was, there was wrong,",,,
A,it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good,",,,
A,the balance isn't right.,,,
A,It doesn't make sense.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,very true.,,,
B,"Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Race or nationality even.,,,
A,"Uh-huh,",,,
A,yeah.,,,
B,"But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,",,,
B,but it's the best one we've got.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,right.,,,
A,"So, let's put up with it, I guess.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.",,,
B,Sure enough.,,,
A,So.,,,
B,"Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.",,,
A,"Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack,",,,
A,and I hope you have a real good day and week.,,,
B,Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.,,,

B,Bye.,,,
A,Bye-bye.,,,
