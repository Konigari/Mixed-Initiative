B,I want to go someplace different up there.,,,
A,That's right.,,,
B,"Uh, my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, uh, money be no object. You know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where I want to, rent a car if I want to. Uh, you know, just the, really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, um, you know, again we, we fit that in there or not.",,,

B,"and, and, uh, I like that kind of stuff.",,,
B,I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery,,,
A,Yes.,,,
A,"I, I agree.",,,
A,"I can, I can do that too,",,,
