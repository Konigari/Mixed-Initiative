A,How do you feel about gun control?,,,
B,"Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed",,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"but it's going to,",,,
B,"a lot of the stuff that,",,,
B,"I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"that,",,,
B,well do you even know what the procedures are now?,,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"There is no national,",,,
B,"But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.",,,
A,"Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,",,,
A,"and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.",,,
B,Huh. I didn't know that.,,,
B,"Well, that's pretty scary.",,,
B,"So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.",,,
A,"Uh, yeah,",,,
A,"I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.",,,
B,That's where I would probably be,,,
A,"Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.",,,
B,"Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better",,,
A,Uh-huh,,,
B,"because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and I can understand them wanting to have them,",,,
B,but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.,,,
A,"Well, you know, uh, uh,",,,
A,"if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know",,,
A,the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.,,,
B,It has?,,,
B,"Because then,",,,
A,Well I mean  yeah.,,,
A,"The, uh, the",,,
A,in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.,,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out  there already.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.",,,
B,"Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?",,,
A,"Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.",,,
A,"I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,",,,
A,"but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.",,,
B,Yeah,,,
B,I know Dallas is.,,,
A,"Uh.  I mean, I think, you know, in the",,,
A,I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.,,,
B,I don't know if Dallas is in the top three,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,but. Do you own a gun?,,,
A,No.,,,
A,I've thought about getting one.,,,
A,"If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.",,,
A,I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.,,,
A,I would probably get like a shotgun.,,,
A,"Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,I do kind of live in the downtown area.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"You know and shotguns are really good because they're,",,,
A,"I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.",,,
B,That's true.,,,
A,"Uh, and you know, you,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,"I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.",,,
A,"They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,",,,
A,they are probably going to miss the person,,,
A,"and, and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, you know.",,,
A,I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.,,,
A,You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,You pretty much stop them.,,,
A,"And, you don't,",,,
A,"then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.",,,
B,"and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,so I finally ended up giving it back to him.,,,
B,I said I don't want it.,,,
B,"I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns",,,
A,"because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,",,,
A,"but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that, that person rushes you.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,And they get it from you.,,,
A,"And you know, you're pretty much dead  you know.  Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then, You know",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Set them off.,,,
A,"and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them",,,
A,"and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.,,,
B,"I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to you know, if I don't really know how to use it",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and I just didn't want the responsibility.,,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,right.,,,
B,That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I would be scared selling guns to people.,,,
