B,I see.,,,
A,But I always have been,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,and I stay up with it.,,,

B,"Um uh, well, some of both.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,

B,"and I read magazines, and such.",,,
A,"Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.",,,
B,"Well, yeah,",,,
B,"I mean, not, not that badly anyway,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"so I am, I am interested in what's going on,",,,
B,"and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there",,,
A,"Uh-huh,",,,
A,"yes,",,,
A,uh-huh.,,,
A,"Oh, you've been there",,,
B,"and, yeah.",,,
A,"well, you would be interested in it then.",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,exactly.,,,
A,"Yeah, uh,",,,
A,"I follow it, you know,",,,
A,"I don't just read everything about it,",,,
A,but I'm always aware of what's going on like that,,,
B,"Yep,",,,
A,"and, uh, because it is, it's interesting",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and, uh, I don't know,",,,
A,"I feel sorry for those people down there,",,,
A,"they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,",,,
B,That's true.,,,
B,"They've never really had a good leader,",,,
A,I mean he was a terrible tyrant,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and I think it's been better since he died,",,,
A,but it's still been bad,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, uh,",,,
A,"I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.",,,
B,"Oh, yeah?",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"he was pretty, pretty much a,",,,
A,"he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"But, uh, It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,",,,
B,I see.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"but, uh, but then again, who, you know,",,,
A,those people are so used to it,,,
A,I guess it's the only thing that works.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?,,,
A,"I think it's pretty darned good,",,,
A,I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,I really do.,,,
A,"Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme,",,,
A,"the media does,",,,
A,"but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,",,,
A,and I listen to the radio,,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,right.,,,
A,"so I, you hear so much,",,,
A,"you get a little tired of it,",,,
A,"but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe",,,
B,Yep.,,,
A,"but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,I really don't.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better,",,,
B,"but I,  would agree that  it's pretty good.",,,
A,I  don't think so.,,,
A,I don't think our news could be better.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,I don't see anything that they could do.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"well, I think that, um,",,,
B,I don't know.,,,
A,"Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon",,,
B,"The, um,",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"I understand what you're saying,",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,"I think that,",,,
A,"But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.",,,
B,"Well, that may be so,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,Uh nothing is perfect.,,,
B,I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"Well, that's true,",,,
A,"I understand what you're saying,",,,
A,"and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,",,,
A,that's why we have C N N.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Right.,,,
