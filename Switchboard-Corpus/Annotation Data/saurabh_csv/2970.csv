B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,But the crime is so bad there.,,,

B,I know,,,
A,"I mean, I do not,",,,

B,You can't trust anybody.,,,
A,"I do not have any, uh, cure,",,,
B,"It is, it is really scary.",,,
A,"No,",,,
A,you really can't.,,,

A,And they have a real big thing here.,,,
A,"People, I mean, even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, you know.",,,
A,"They, everybody wants your business kind of thing.",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"And my husband is the kind of guy, he's, he's sometime,",,,
A,"he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.",,,
A,"And I think sometimes it is just, he and I are very different in terms of that.",,,
A,"I, I mean, I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts.",,,
B,Right.,,,
B,"We,",,,
A,"And, uh, he opened the door.",,,
A,I came downstairs,,,
A,and I was real upset,,,
A,and I probably got more nasty than I should have.,,,
A,"But I just said, Howard,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"you know,",,,
A,"oh, my God.",,,
A,"I would not, I mean,",,,
B,"Well, you, you, hear about people opening the door and getting blown away.",,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,

A,"I mean, I have been to New York.",,,
A,You should not deny yourself going to visit and all that.,,,

A,"I used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by, uh,",,,
A,are you from Boston?,,,
B,Yeah.,,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And I know I never felt,",,,

A,and I have been to downtown Boston.,,,
A,"And I never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston, staying at the Meridian,",,,
A,I did not pay for.,,,
A,"But, I mean, I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city I have been in, you know.",,,
B,Right.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,So I would say one thing.,,,
A,"Do not deny yourself the New York experience, but go with people that you know.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,I would not want to go by myself.,,,
A,"No, uh.",,,
A,"But I mean, it, yeah, I do not know.",,,
A,"I mean, I, I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals. Uh,",,,
A,"I think the handgun,",,,
A,I am not real big on guns myself.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So,",,,
B,"I think our justice system needs to be stricter. I mean, because everyone, they do it",,,
A,"I mean,",,,
A,"Are the New York, uh, are the New York,",,,
A,I do not know how the New York state prison system is,,,
A,"but, Are they booked up?",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"That is a way to put it,",,,

A,"Are they paroling, uh, like murderers",,,
A,"and, I mean, here it is just a real big deal.",,,
A,They parole people that have killed police officers,,,
A,and then they are out doing it again.,,,
B,"Right, um,",,,
B,"I do not, I do not know. Because I am not real up on a lot of news things.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"But, you know, you just hear about that, that, you know,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,it is a lot of repeat crime.,,,
B,"And you are like, why are they repeating?",,,
B,They should have been in there longer.,,,
B,"Or,",,,
A,I know.,,,
A,"And then you think, I mean, I I mean, I can remember, I have not been out of school that long,",,,
A,but it has been at least ten years.,,,
A,"And you think to yourself, was it that bad back then?",,,
A,"Or is it just,",,,
A,"I think that, like you said, television?",,,
A,"Is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it, you know?",,,
A,"I mean, people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.",,,
B,"It seems like a lot of,",,,
B,"that it is more, like in Boston,",,,
B,"there was a case of, uh, a couple of kids, fifteen year olds.",,,
B,They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"So they, they picked on this kid who was like new in town.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"And they were like, well, no one was going to miss him anyway, you know,",,,
B,"and it like,",,,
A,"Oh, god.",,,
B,"ugh, that is horrible.",,,

A,"it is, yeah, isn't it something?",,,
A,"I mean, I, I have a, I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,",,,
A,and I have a niece and nephew.,,,
A,"And I just, uh, I mean",,,
A,"my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going, Michael, how did you hear about that?",,,
A,"You know, it is just, I think kids get too much too fast. And all those sort of things.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, uh, they had that thing, you know, the high top sneakers, the Air Jordans, et cetera.",,,
B,Right.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,Kids killing each other and beating their brains out.,,,

A,"Or the, or the jackets, the team like the Raiders and the caps.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"You know, stealing the hundred dollar jackets.",,,
A,"Uh, I mean, it is I guess, it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they, in Boston.",,,
A,That is crime where they videoed.,,,
A,That is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,Where they videotape themselves.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
