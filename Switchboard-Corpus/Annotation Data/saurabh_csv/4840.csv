A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,And it's good,,,
B,"but it's, it's the price they pay",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be, uh, as far as cash flow, a lot, uh, have be, tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't generate a larger a, a large amount of revenue because there's so little, uh, currency flow through out the economic system",,,

B,"I think in a, in a way it's good, in a way it's not.",,,
B,"Uh, but I think in general it's probably good.",,,
B,"I mean, a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been, have been, in the past, uh, have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them,  against  the taxes for them. Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
