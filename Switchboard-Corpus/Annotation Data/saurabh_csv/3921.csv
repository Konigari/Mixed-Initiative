B,I like to fish.,,,

B,"and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and it's driving me crazy,,,

B,sure.,,,
A,"Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,",,,
B,Well,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.",,,
B,"Uh, and you're right.",,,
B,I mean I like to fish for trout,,,
B,"and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters",,,
B,"but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,I know.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish",,,

A,"We, uh,  skin them.",,,
B,Do you?,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,Okay.,,,

A,yeah.,,,
A,Just cut their heads off and skin them,,,
A,"and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,I don't put that corn meal on them.,,,
B,No.,,,
A,"You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them",,,
A,so,,,
B,"Well, that's how we do it too.",,,
B,"Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out",,,
B,"and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish",,,
B,"and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and then the skin just basically scrapes right off,,,
B,"and, uh,",,,
B,and it really tastes pretty good.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.",,,
B,"There, uh,",,,
A,"Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"So, uh,",,,
B,"Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel",,,
B,"but, uh so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines",,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"so,",,,
A,Wouldn't that be something?,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike",,,
B,"and, uh, they really, uh,",,,
B,"in, in,",,,
B,"when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,",,,
B,"but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So when you were,",,,
A,when you did go fishing where did you go?,,,
A,You moved there from where?,,,
A,Nebraska?,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the lakes I suppose, huh?",,,
B,"In, In Nebraska?",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Uh, yeah.",,,
B,"Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,",,,
B,"so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and so we would do a lot of fishing there too,,,
B,"but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for,",,,
