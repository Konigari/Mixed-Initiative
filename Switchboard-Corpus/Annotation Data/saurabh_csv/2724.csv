A,"and I learned all the health benefits of, you know,",,,
A,"I was a solid weight trainer,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise,,,
A,"and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it,",,,
A,"so, once I got into this, uh, internship, I learned all the physiological advantages to it,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"so I began a program couple, I don't know probably three or four weeks ago",,,
A,and I did my first bike rally this Saturday.,,,
A,"I did, uh, forty, forty miles,",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"and, uh, that's the longest I've ever ridden so far,",,,
A,"I usually, you know, fifteen or twenty.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And it was, it was kind of hilly",,,

B,"Oh, I see.",,,
A,"and I, I kind of held her back a little bit this, this weekend.",,,
A,"She wanted to go, go, go,",,,
A,"but, you know, she wanted to stay with me",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,It's good to have a partner.,,,

B,"I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from Vermont or, you know, that kind of, thing.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,I mean people seem to get into different aspects.,,,
B,"One is more of a distance,",,,
B,"and one's more, just, you know,",,,
B,they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.,,,
A,I've never really looked into that.,,,
A,"That, you know, that's,",,,
A,my wife would just love that.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,And I may do that sometime.,,,
A,"There again, I'm just kind of a fledgling into this.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I've, it's kind of funny.",,,
A,I called this number,,,
A,and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"I mean, around Texas, you, you got about five or six,",,,

B,Yeah.,,,
A,Because I lived in Indiana all my life,,,
A,"and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, or above the age of fifteen or something,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,I'm not sure why that is.,,,
B,"I mean, generally in the Midwest it seems to be less, much less.",,,
B,"I mean, maybe it's because of the winters. Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the West.",,,
A,Probably.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"It, there's a lot of bikers around here.",,,
A,"It's, it's really neat.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"There are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,",,,
A,"little TEXAS BICYCLIST, is like a little newspaper that comes out every month.",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,It's free,,,

A,"and it's got all the rides coming up,",,,
A,"so I guess I'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer, going to a different ride.",,,
B,"Oh, that's terrific.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So, uh, how long have you been biking?",,,
B,"Oh, I guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so",,,
B,"Uh, you know, I guess last time I did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, yeah,",,,
B,"I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while, uh, until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot.",,,
B,"And so I thought I'd try it, too.",,,
A,"Have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking, to see if it,",,,
B,"No,",,,
B,"I haven't,",,,
B,no.,,,
A,"because it really, from what I understand, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"and, you know, it, uh, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you know, the cholesterol.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls.,,,
B,"Oh, that's great.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,so ...,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,

A,Yeah.,,,
B,"You know, it gets it down to about forty.",,,
A,Really?,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,That's good.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,

A,When do you get to begin with the winters and all that?,,,
A,"What time of the year do you usually embark on your,",,,
A,do you ride inside if you can't ride outside?,,,
B,"No,",,,
B,I'm not that hard-core.,,,
B,"I mean there are some people,",,,
B,in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow.,,,
B,"They've got a, uh, mountain bike, you know, with the big knobby tires.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, I don't do that.",,,
B,"I basically, I, I pretty much lay off for the winter.",,,
B,"Uh, I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter, you know, because it will help your balance when you're indoor training.",,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"Uh, but I just, you know, more or less stocked, like an exercise bike and that kind of thing. uh,",,,
B,"but, yeah,",,,
B,I mean winters are kind of a problem,,,
B,"so, I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking, I guess, this year for just a couple of weeks.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Uh, but, you know, up here it's only stopped snowing since then.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Uh, but, yeah,",,,
B,"it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good.",,,
B,"It's, uh,",,,
B,"the main, the main thing, I guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know, exercise and a chore I'll lay off it more.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"So you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep a ...",,,
B,"Oh, yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
B,"I try to go someplace pretty different, you know, every week.",,,
B,"I rotate around, uh, about four different routes, uh, from my house",,,
B,or I'll sometimes come in the school.,,,
B,"It's nice coming,",,,
B,"it's, it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path uh,",,,
B,"because it's just, it's along the Erie Canal up here.",,,
A,"So, what school is it?",,,
B,"Uh, University of Rochester.",,,
A,"Oh, okay.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,So it's fairly picturesque.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, so it's, it's, it's a good ride",,,
B,"as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,That's true.,,,
A,Sounds neat.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"It's kind of,",,,
