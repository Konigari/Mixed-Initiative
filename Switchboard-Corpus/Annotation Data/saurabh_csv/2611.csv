B,"well,",,,
A,"Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful uh, sweater from, uh, I believe it was Ross Dress For Less",,,

A,"and they had like just sewed it back together,  right in  the middle of the back, you know,",,,
B,"Oh, no.",,,
A,"wasn't a seam or anything, you know.",,,
B,Uh-huh,,,
A,"And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really noticeable, like she was moving the uh, from the outside,",,,
A,"but, but still, it's, you know, it's really not, not, not a good quality.",,,
A,"And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.",,,
B,The defect.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,"um, they don't really buy the first quality,",,,
A,they buy the second.,,,
A,"And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds,",,,
A,they'll send them back every time.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"But  places like Ross Dress For Less and, uh, T J Max.",,,
