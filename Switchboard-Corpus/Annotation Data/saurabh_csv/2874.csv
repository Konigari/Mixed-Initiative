B,"and we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass",,,
B,"and usually you pull up, you know, thirteen to fourteen inch bass.",,,
A,Wow.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass",,,

B,so what they'll do is,,,
B,"you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,",,,

B,and they'll be boating around,,,

A,"uh, the other day I was fishing with bread, uh,",,,
A,there's a college across the street,,,

A,"they, they zip through the water, you know,",,,
A,"you're, how your line goes, you know",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and I thought, you know, that, uh, I wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, uh, the one I hooked just about ten minutes before, when I tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,",,,
A,so it wasn't hooked very well.,,,
A,"But, you know, I got it that far,",,,
A,"I figured that, uh,",,,
B,"That, that, that counts.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,that's what I  said.,,,

A,"and there's,",,,
A,he has two ponds up there,,,
A,"and my uncle has a, a pond upstream",,,
A,and there's a lot of crappie in there now.,,,
A,"But, uh, I think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a big enough crappie to eat.",,,
A,"But the catfish, there's, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and,  that,",,,
A,yeah.,,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,"so  you can just, oh,",,,

B,"It's sort of,",,,
B,"so when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"and if, you know,",,,
A,"when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.",,,

B,We just dropped it down there,,,
B,"and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat",,,
