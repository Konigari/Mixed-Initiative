A,and sometimes I go for fairly exotic things.,,,
A,"And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,that's true.,,,
A,"Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe",,,
A,and it was just a total bust.,,,

B,"and, uh, we took some",,,
B,"and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,",,,

B,and he never did finish it.,,,
A,Um.,,,

B,"It's, uh, supposed to be candy.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,",,,
B,"it was, you know. It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, uh, into a kind of a candy stick,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"so, uh.",,,
A,"Huh, see I am not,",,,
A,that's interesting.,,,
A,One of the things I do not make is dessert.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.",,,
A,"And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Huh.,,,
A,"Uh, everything else was fine,",,,
A,but that was a fiasco.,,,
B,"Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.",,,
B,"Or,",,,
A,"Uh, yeah.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,just about.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Use about half the sugar,",,,
B,or make everything diet.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Uh, do you cook for yourself",,,
A,or do you cook for others?,,,

A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And,",,,
B,"It's easy,",,,
B,that's for sure.,,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
A,"And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,",,,
A,"if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,I always put cheese on them.,,,
A,"And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,",,,
B,it's mostly starch.,,,
B,"So, it fills you up",,,
B,and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"I I did not say it was nourishing,",,,
A,but it was satisfying.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah,",,,
B,it really is.,,,
A,"And,",,,
B,Then you have to make a salad,,,
B,"or,",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,yeah,,,
A,"but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,",,,
A,so I ate very simply.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.",,,
A,"I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh,",,,
B,Except you get to taste the product instead .,,,
A,"Yes,",,,
A,and have an explosion.,,,
B,Fill them up,,,
B,or blow up.,,,
A,Sometimes it blows up anyway.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.",,,
A,"And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe",,,
A,"and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,",,,
A,and it does turn to toffee inside the can.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah",,,
A,"And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.",,,
A,"It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.",,,
A,"And, and the boy friend thought,",,,
A,"it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,",,,
A,"so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang",,,
A,and there he was.,,,
A,"And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.",,,
B,Right.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Did you let the can cool off?,,,
A,"Uh, I really do not remember,",,,
A,"that was about ten years ago,",,,
A,I just remember how embarrassing it was.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before",,,
A,"and I never had that problem,",,,
A,just that one time.,,,
B,Huh. Yeah.,,,
A,"And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,",,,
A,he was kind of pushy too.,,,
A,"Acted like, he came from San Francisco",,,
A,and he had a very sophisticated taste.,,,
A,"I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him",,,
A,"and, and well, it was a memorable evening anyway.",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"Uh, as far as,",,,
A,"I, I do enjoy cooking",,,
A,"so, I was awfully glad I was given this,",,,
