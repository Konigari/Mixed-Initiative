B,"Um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, Raleigh uh, on air pollution.",,,
A,"Oh, you mean for like smog and stuff?",,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,"because of there so many cars,",,,
B,and we have a belt line around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic.,,,
A,Huh.,,,

B,and you can actually see it.,,,
B,"There's a couple of, uh, tall buildings in Raleigh,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,

B,"they're blurred,",,,
B,"they're even dark,",,,
B,and what it is is the pollution.,,,
A,Huh.,,,
A,"What do you think of that, uh, the greenhouse effect that's going on?",,,

A,Yeah,,,
B,"and, uh,",,,
A,that's causing the hole in the ozone.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,that's very serious.,,,

A,"Well, I'm from Kentucky,",,,
A,I should know,,,
A,"but, I don't,",,,
A,I'm sorry.,,,
A,"But Kentucky, we use to have severe, I mean, just real cold, cold winters",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,and we'd have three and four feet of snow.,,,
A,"Course here in Texas they don't have snow,",,,
A,they don't know what snow is.,,,

B,I almost forgot my age.,,,
A,Okay.,,,
A,"Well, we're the same age.",,,
B,"Oh, really?",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I forget my age all the time,",,,
A,so that's okay.,,,
A,"It's, I think it's just something that goes with the territory.",,,
B,Um,,,
A,"But to me, Texas, see and Kentucky, we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school.",,,
A,Okay?,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"In Texas, I'm serious, if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain, I, I swear they close everything down.",,,
A,I just laugh.,,,
A,"I mean, I do,",,,
A,"they get, I mean,",,,
A,and traffic slows down to nothing.,,,
B,"Actually, they've been doing the same thing here.",,,
B,"It's, you know, it's kind of funny,",,,
B,"they, um, I guess northerners are different,",,,
B,"but even, uh, North Carolinians, they don't know how to handle cold weather.",,,
A,"Oh, well, no",,,
A,"I'm from the north,",,,
A,"that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we,",,,
A,"I don't know,",,,
A,"you just get used to the weather,",,,
A,"and of course the people down in south, they they're not used to cold weather and stuff,",,,
A,"and, uh, it just,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I don't know,",,,
A,I just laugh,,,
A,"every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground everything's closed up.",,,
A,"And you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road",,,
B,That's true.,,,
A,"But, uh,",,,
B,Do you all have much pollution there?,,,
A,"No,",,,
A,"not really,",,,
A,"I mean, not to see it.",,,
A,"Now of course, there's, you know, T I is here, Oscar Mayer",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and there is a few factories,",,,
A,but I don't see much pollution going on.,,,
B,"Well, you know, what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe.,,,
A,"Well, see, they have that, um, what is it a test, or something like that they call it.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh,  that's supposed to cut down on it.",,,
B,"Well,",,,
B,supposedly that's supposed to catch it.,,,
B,"But I'll tell you what,",,,
B,"and even these buses, oh lord, it real bad. These buses in Raleigh,",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"school buses and the commercial buses,",,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
A,yeah.,,,
B,"I mean, school buses are notorious.",,,
A,"Well, they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is.",,,
B,"Oh, yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"And, uh, it, it gets bad.",,,
B,"Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and that way it gets above, um, other cars on the road",,,
A,"Well, that's a good idea.",,,
B,"and, uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, you know,",,,
B,"even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles,",,,
B,"and, and, you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable.",,,
B,"I would, I'd have to go out to the country to jog.",,,
A,"Well, uh, the, you know, pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes.",,,
B,"No,",,,
B,I didn't know that.,,,
A,"When I was pregnant with my first little boy, I had read it,",,,
A,"because back then because I was walking back and forth,",,,
A,"well not back and forth,",,,
A,"I was walking home from, uh, the college I was going to in Kentucky.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,And I was having to walk along the highway.,,,
A,It was just one day a week.,,,
A,"But it was, in,",,,
A,"I, I have no sense of smell,",,,
A,"so I couldn't smell this,",,,
A,"but it would make me sick,",,,
A,and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway.,,,
B,Um.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Golly, that's, that's bad.",,,
A,"But,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,"it's,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,"all the exhaust. Uh,",,,
A,"well, that was four years ago, too,",,,
A,it's probably a lot worse now.,,,
B,"Oh, I'm sure.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Well, they, um, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,",,,
B,"and if you're older, um, I mean, you can really deplete your oxygen,",,,
B,"and it'll, you know, pass out,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and it's, you know, it's killed several people.",,,
A,"Do you, uh, smoke?",,,
B,"Um, actually, I'm a very, I just smoke one in the evening if that.",,,
B,"So, I'm a very, very light smoker.",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,it's kind of,,,
B,It was kind of funny.,,,
B,"They were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, the E P A",,,
B,"and they were just screening some candidates,",,,
B,"and I don't think I'd ever, you know, do that,",,,
B,"but they, uh, asked me if I was a smoker,",,,
B,"and I didn't fit into the smoker's category,",,,
B,"and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. Um,",,,
B,"it was, you know, I was just one of those",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,because you do smoke one a day.,,,
B,"yeah,",,,
B,in between people.,,,
B,So that kind of threw them off.,,,
A,"Um. Uh,",,,
B,"But they're doing a lot of research here, uh, the E P A",,,
A,For the air pollution.,,,
B,"For ozone, and oh, yeah, all that.",,,
B,"They're, they're real big into it.",,,
B,"They've got Research Triangle Park here,",,,
B,"and they're, you know, they're just doing a lot of, uh, lot of stuff.",,,
A,Huh.,,,
A,"But, they,",,,
A,I don't hear much about it down here.,,,
A,"Course, Texas, we don't have a bunch of pollution.",,,
B,Huh-uh.,,,
A,"But, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast.",,,
B,"Oh, uh-huh.",,,
A,And you know it'd blow it up north.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So, maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"But, no",,,
A,"it would seem like it would be the same way in, on the California coastline, wouldn't it?",,,
B,"Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"I mean, I can't believe they have warnings here, which it, it's mainly just when it gets real, real hot.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially.,,,
B,Really?,,,
B,"well that's kind of good to know,",,,
B,"because I thought lord, I thought I lived in a halfway decent area.",,,
A,I think they do that for most everybody.,,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"especially, it's usually for the young children and the older, the old people older old people.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Well you ought to come to North Carolina.,,,
B,It's a big change,,,
A,It is?,,,
