A,Right.,,,
B,"we have it,  you know.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"And when, when we see something on sale, uh, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a  medical bill.  Everything's taken care of.",,,

B,or I can just carry it over.,,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Uh, you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months.  And  certain times when that will be left over.",,,
