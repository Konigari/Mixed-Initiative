A,and I'm ready to get rid of it,,,
A,"Actually,",,,
B,"Oh, it's not pretty old.",,,
A,"No,",,,
A,"uh, well, I I had an eighty-eight that I really liked",,,
A,"and it got wrecked,",,,
A,"and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my eighty-eight",,,
A,"and I've had a lot of problems with this one,",,,
A,"so,",,,
B,"So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?",,,
A,"Well, you,",,,
A,"it's, it's kind of funny, um,",,,
A,"I know a lot,",,,
B,"Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together,",,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,so.,,,
A,"It's, it's true,",,,
A,"it's definitely true because,",,,
B,"But, but that's one reason",,,
B,"I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,",,,
B,"that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh, for, you know, low maintenance,",,,
B,so.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"well, Honda does too that's why I was really,",,,
B,"Well, really,",,,
B,"there's, there's no question",,,

A,Yeah.,,,
B,"I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,",,,
A,That's true.,,,
B,"and they're still beating on them,",,,
A,That's true.,,,
B,and it's just amazing,,,
B,"and then they got,",,,
B,"and you know they're not making them like that now, you know,",,,
A,"No,",,,
B,"so,",,,
A,not at all.,,,
B,"but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .",,,
A,"Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, because I had, uh, uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda,",,,
A,and it was the worst car I've ever owned,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda",,,
A,it was just a wonderful car,,,
A,and then it got wrecked,,,
A,"and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want,",,,
A,"and I really have had a lot of problems with it,",,,
A,but I don't know.,,,
B,"Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody",,,
A,"Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty",,,
A,"but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month,",,,
A,it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,that's a lot.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"it was,",,,
A,"I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped up on Honda,",,,
A,so.,,,
B,"Oh, well.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Anyway,",,,
B,"so, what's your next purchase supposed to be?",,,
A,"Well, I know this,",,,
B,"Oh, really ,",,,
B,"if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?",,,
A,"Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange,",,,
A,"but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van,",,,
A,I really like those,,,
A,"and I have kids,",,,
A,so.,,,
B,I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that.,,,
A,"They're a lot,",,,
A,"I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van, and the, the new Chevy Lumina van,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I don't know what you, normal,",,,
A,"I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type.",,,
A,"I, I'm not sure how to explain it,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"no,",,,
A,what,,,
A,"Astro, Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that,",,,
B,"Oh, okay,",,,
B,yeah .,,,

B,"Do you have, uh, do you have a family?",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,I have a couple kids,,,
B,"Okay,",,,
B,"well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit .",,,
A,"Oh, yeah,",,,
A,definitely.,,,
A,"But, I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning,",,,
A,"I'm sure you can, uh, relate to air conditioning Um, living in Arizona,",,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
A,"but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it,",,,
A,"I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college",,,
B,"and, uh, you know, I always been looking for something sporty",,,
B,"and I ended up getting, you know, basically something that I could, you know, afford.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,The only gripe I have is performance.,,,
B,"I probably, uh,",,,
B,"a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X sevens and stuff",,,
B,"and they're, they're pretty fun to drive,",,,
B,"so, so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around, I keep, I keep holding off",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Oh, really?",,,
B,"and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to",,,
B,"but I just, I,",,,
B,it's just such a huge expense,,,

B,"Huh,",,,
B,"anyway, um, but I'll probably, um,",,,
A,Huh.,,,
B,"it just depends,",,,
B,"I know that's what I want,",,,
B,"but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money,",,,
B,"you're looking at, you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something,",,,
B,"you're looking at twenty-five K or something, that like",,,

A,Really?,,,
A,"Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition.",,,
B,"Well, I don't know,",,,
B,"I think the demand's gone all, down a little bit.",,,
B,"I think you can,",,,
B,"the prices aren't as high, you know,",,,
B,"and the, the Miata was first introduced, uh,",,,
A,"And, well , they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?",,,
B,"yeah,",,,
B,"the demand is so, high that, uh, you know, they were going to retail them around like you know, thirteen standard, you know,",,,
B,"and you get your options, your looking at fifteen or fifteen",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,That's true.,,,
B,"but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and, um, they, they may have gone down a little bit",,,
A,Huh.,,,
B,"but I,",,,
B,they're still pretty much in demand.,,,
B,"I think there's another car coming in,",,,
B,"it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata,",,,
A,Huh.,,,
B,and I can't remember what I read about that,,,
B,"but so, that's ,",,,
B,"I mean, I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular,",,,
B,so.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,it really is.,,,
B,"But,",,,
A,"Have you seen the new, uh, Dodge Stealth? The, the,  real nice one",,,

B,"well, that's, that's, that's the same manufacturer",,,
A,now those are nice,,,
B,"and so , they just market them.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"But, uh, yeah,",,,
B,"those are and those are supposed to be very performance power, I mean, they're, there is, yeah, big time.",,,
A,"The expensive ones, they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand,",,,
A,"but those are pretty stripped,",,,
A,"and there's nothing,",,,
A,"there's really,",,,
A,"that one's just more for looks, you know,",,,
A,"it doesn't have any, really the performance that the expensive one does.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"You know, but I've seen one of those,",,,
A,"and it's not that great, I mean, because they really,",,,
B,"I think they're only around, uh, twenty-nine K.",,,

B,"Yeah,",,,
B,I'm being single,,,
B,"and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess, you know, it's, I can, I can, I've been pretty happy,",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,",,,
B,"that's, uh, you know, I could, I could have, you know, get something nice and upgrade",,,
B,"but I just, uh, I'm consulting right now,",,,
