B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or  something  like that.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like ninety-nine percentile and  this and that.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"And it's like,",,,
B,"Well, that's what they look for.",,,
B,"Whether or not they get it is hard to say like a chair is drug across the * spelling: ""dragged"", not ""drug"" in this case",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,I know.,,,

B,Yeah,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,It's  pretty tough.,,,
B,It's pretty tough,,,
B,"I,",,,

A,"I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it",,,
A,so.,,,
B,"Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps that keeps people  in .",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"They, they like what they're doing.",,,
B,"They, you know, they feel good about what they're doing.",,,
B,That type of thing.,,,
B,It's more,,,

A,"the,",,,
A,"once you get your Masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a year.",,,
B,Uh-huh,,,
A,And  and that's  not what they're paying.,,,
B,"Oh, easily,",,,
B,I'm sure.,,,
B,No.,,,
B,"Well, it depends on what rank you are,  of course",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,I know,,,
B,"I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"But that's, uh,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Those are few and far between  though.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"It's like,  it's like, uh, in I B M.",,,
A,"In I B M, you can get certain points",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and, uh, everyone's a manager.",,,
A,"But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn  so much money.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Since  I imagine it's fairly  competitive.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"It's like,",,,
A,no,,,
A,"I, I mean, I B M is like,",,,
A,"there's a joke about I B M which says, you know, it's like, uh,",,,
A,"all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right?",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.",,,
B,Uh-huh,,,
A,And then they come in last,,,
A,"and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Saying,",,,
A,"he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right.",,,
A,"So he goes,  have you come up with a uh, have you come up with a solution?",,,
A,"They go, yeah,",,,
A,change the rower,,,
A,"You know, it's like everyone's a,  manager",,,
A,"but, you know,  it's like  only use like one person does the work",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,so.,,,
B,Too many chiefs and  not enough Indians.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,So.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"I don't know,",,,
B,"that can be, that, that can really slow you down.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well, that's the way it works.",,,
A,"I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems.",,,
A,"I mean, everyone's a manager",,,
A,"and,",,,
B,I didn't realize that.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there are, uh, very few.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And then the other people just plan it, you know.",,,
A,"It's like,  it's like have you, have  have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the, with, uh, the think tank? You know,",,,
B,push paper around.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, you know, like what shall we do?",,,
A,Has anybody thought of anything?,,,
A,No.,,,
A,"And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.",,,
A,They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world,,,
A,"and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know,",,,
A,so they have this think tank.,,,
A,And they got to come up with ideas.,,,
A,"But, see, uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that  everybody will buy their stuff.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,"They've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know,",,,
B,"people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.",,,
B,"Whereas if you try something different, they'll  they'll say  yeah,",,,
A,And it fails,,,
A,and  you're dead.,,,
B,"why didn't you buy,  why didn't you try something more mainline.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,Well I B M  doesn't fire anybody.,,,
A,"Because  uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job. Which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.",,,
B,No.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,So you quit.,,,
B,Uh.,,,
A,I mean that's their policy.,,,
A,They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.,,,
B,"Illegal or something  like that,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,like  if you're stealing something or doing anything like that,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,But they won't let you off.,,,
A,What they'll do is like,,,
A,"suppose, you know, like you're a manager.",,,
A,"So they'll  put  you into keeping up the paper, you know.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,It's like how much paper is going in?,,,
A,"And then  you  say that's not my job,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,so you quit.,,,
B,"So, in other words, that's the way they  force  people out",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"That's why they can say, you know, there's  no layoff  policy.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"But it they don't really say that, you know,",,,
B,"you're, you're always going to have great  career  conditions.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"hey, that's kind  of sad.",,,
A,"No,",,,
A,"but  I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different policy.",,,
A,I don't know.,,,
A,My dad works for them,,,
A,"but it's like I B M like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.",,,
A,"It's like they won't say,",,,
B,No.,,,
B,"Well, they're the standard right now.",,,
B,"Or as far as that goes, you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.",,,
B,"And the main,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.,,,
A,And anybody can fix it.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,And so that's what you're going to go for.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big  thing.",,,
A,"And,  and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge.",,,
A,Have you ever heard of Leading Edge?,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,They are out of Korea right.,,,
A,What?,,,
B,Leading Edge.,,,
B,Don't they,,,
A,"They, they made like, uh, small personal computers.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,Small P C,,,
B,they're out of Korea right?,,,
A,I don't know.,,,
A,I don't know.,,,
A,"But what they do is, what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"for example, you test a chip.",,,
A,It can't last seven years,,,
A,but it can last five.,,,
A,I B M says let's throw it away.,,,
A,Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.,,,
B,Okay.,,,
A,"And so that's,",,,
A,"I mean, they're still around I think.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"I've seen, well I've seen them around  anyway. You know .",,,
A,"So, that's what they do.",,,
A,"They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away",,,
A,"and they , and that's why they're so compatible. Because I mean",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway.  You know.",,,
B,Most people do.,,,
B,Or they have to anyway.,,,
A,"Well, I mean, there's like, well",,,
A,"in a way you realize,",,,
A,"I mean, one one of my teachers got this computer which, you know,",,,
A,"it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,And he got that.,,,
A,"He said, you know, it's like, uh,",,,
A,"I was testing it * LISTEN to this sequence that begins here and ends with A.215 utt 11. I can't tell how much Speaker A is quoting, and how much he'she is directly addressing Speaker B.",,,
A,and it was wonderful.,,,
A,"And then when you tried to erase and correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.",,,
B,Wow.,,,
A,"And I want more,  you know.",,,
A,"And it's like Jesus Christ, you know,",,,
A,it's like why do you want more.,,,
A,Because it's like one second of recording.,,,
A,I mean you put into Wave,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and you want to correct the errors into Wave,",,,
A,"it takes so much,",,,
A,"I mean, it's like,",,,
A,of course it does.,,,
A,"I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model",,,
A,"and you put it in there,",,,
A,and you want to correct those.,,,
A,"And then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth",,,
A,"so you can approximately,",,,
A,of course it's going to take a lot.,,,
A,"Imagine, imagine  what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.",,,
B,It's amazing.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"It's like, Jesus Christ.",,,
B,"Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory they're going to  require.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know,  standard  memory or disk  disk base,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,so.,,,
A,"Well, like  they say, like nobody can get enough, you know.",,,
A,"It's like once you have  something,",,,
A,and it's like,,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,"You find out more,",,,
A,I was watching this program on T V yesterday.,,,
A,In nineteen seventy-six NASA came up with Three D graphics.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,Right.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And they were showing this like Three D Three D graphics view of like,",,,
B,Like the deal?,,,
A,What?,,,
A,"No,",,,
A,"no,",,,
A,no.,,,
B,Like a hologram?,,,
A,"This is like,  this is like  video game stuff.",,,
B,"With just graphics on, on a,",,,
A,Okay?,,,
B,Okay,,,
A,"But the only thing was, that it was just lines,",,,
A,okay.,,,
A,Like if you,,,
