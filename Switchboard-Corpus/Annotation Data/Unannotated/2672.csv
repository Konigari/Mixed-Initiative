A,"I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,  rather  than bag it up, because of all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and it's, uh, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.",Minor Topic End,,
B,"Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?",Minor Topic Start,,Talking about SAVE AMERICA
A,I saw part of that.,,,

A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"But I've already gone to,",,,

B,"I'm trying to think,",,,
B,"I didn't miss too many,",,,
B,"I can't remember what my score was,",,,

A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"well there are a lot of things that aren't,",,,
A,"I'm ,",,,
A,"that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,",,,
A,"uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.",,,
A,"I, I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.",Minor Topic End,,
B,"Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,",Minor Topic Start,,Talking about cost of recycling

B,and it cost more than regular paper.,,,
A,Um.,,,
B,"And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,",,,
B,"but, It upset me to realize that, hey, the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"but people aren't buying it,",,,
B,so the cost of it is higher.,,,
A,True.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,I noticed that about things like,,,

A,"but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,  what  the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So, in, in terms of that,",,,
A,"it's,",,,
A,"you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,",,,
A,but the cost is kind of prohibitive.,,,
B,"Now, see that's recycling, you know,",,,
B,"companies that do at least go into it,",,,
B,"I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,So that people would use this stuff over again.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,it's a good idea.,Minor Topic End,,
B,"It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and the recycle ones are better to use,",,,
B,but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.,,,

B,I had to put my bifocals on to see it,,,
A,Um.,,,
B,That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.,,,

B,it's not recyclable.,,,
A,"I, I'd heard something stranger,",Minor Topic Start,,Talking about use of recycled goods

A,"I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a, a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Oh, really?",,,
A,"And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,",,,
A,"and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes,",,,
B,Oh.,,,
A,and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.,,,
B,"You know they're,",,,
B,"along that same line, they said they were using, um,",,,
B,"what is, oh, I know,",,,

A,"Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.",,,

B,You know what I'd like to see a little more.,,,
B,"I don't have any little tiny kids,",,,
