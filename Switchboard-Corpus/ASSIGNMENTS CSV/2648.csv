B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and, and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution",,,
A,"and, you know, their their regulation that's placed on them is, I mean, it's better than it used to be",,,

A,"You know, I, I just,",,,
A,I can't stand that,,,
A,"and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,",,,

A,"and I know people that work there that,",,,
A,"of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,",,,

A,"and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything",,,
A,"and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping,",,,
B,Oh.,,,
A,"and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant",,,
A,"I can't imagine plants,",,,
B,"I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even had you know, well,",,,
B,"those chemicals would not,",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to, to break the flours down",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"and then they, they also do testing there,",,,
A,"and I don't,",,,
A,"you know, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive",,,
A,"but toxic can be, can be anything that's uh, classified that can damage the Earth.",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, uh, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,"you know, like in, In packaging",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"and, uh, you know, just goodness.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"but they do, they do a lot of research",,,
A,"and they do, um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there",,,
A,"or,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"I'm not really,",,,
A,"what's it called when you do flour,",,,
A,"I'm not,",,,
B,"Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching",,,

B,"and, uh, they've been there for years.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh,",,,
A,"But,",,,
A,"I mean, you think about it, it, you know,",,,
A,"it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just,",,,
A,I'm not really sure,,,
A,"but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"but when they pollute into the air and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.",,,
A,"So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the",,,
