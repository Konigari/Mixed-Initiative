B,"I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids",,,
B,"and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.",,,
B,"I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.",,,
B,"Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns",,,
B,"and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,",,,

B,"I think a, a one day would be sufficient.",,,
B,The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows,,,

A,"Oh, yeah?",minor topic end,,
B,"So, how do you feel about guns?",,,
A,"Let's see,",,,
A,I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns,,,
A,and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"whether, you know,",,,
B,"Well, do you think that there will continue to always be crazies?",,,

A,"And, uh, I would agree,",,,
A,"a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,",,,
A,"but uh, I think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a, a bit on the extreme side.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.,,,
B,Okay.,,,
B,"Do you, uh, do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a, an automatic handgun?",,,
A,"The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.",,,
A,"or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,",,,
A,"but, uh,",,,
B,"Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,",,,
B,"but, the public, I don't know.",,,
A,I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
