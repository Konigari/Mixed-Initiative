A,so you usually are living where your parents live,,,
A,"and it's all,",,,
A,"your, you don't have to come home,",,,
A,"so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,",,,
A,"but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became  their version of the pilgrimage.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Right.,,,

A,"Well, that's pretty .",,,
B,"We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,",,,
B,"and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.",,,

A,Wow.,,,
A,"You're just, uh,",,,
A,"Oh, that's incredible.",,,
B,"Liked to kill me, because I it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,",,,
B,"I did,  it  by myself.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes.",,,
B,"We had a great big fish fry,",,,
B,"and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.",,,
A,Right,,,
B,"And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.",,,
B,"And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them",,,
B,"and I told him,",,,
A,"Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?",,,
B,"We did it that year,",,,
B,"and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.",,,

B,"and then one by one, his you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,",,,
A,"See, that's",,,
A,we've we had a problem with that.,,,
B,and it was difficult to hold them together.,,,
B,"And then, of course, he died two years ago,",,,
B,"so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"And, uh, it,",,,
B,"I think that's what happens when they get scattered,",,,
B,"the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"That's our,  was our problem.",,,
A,"We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and so it kind of wound down,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and  then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else",,,
A,"so that,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.",,,
B,They'll send out news bulletins.,,,
