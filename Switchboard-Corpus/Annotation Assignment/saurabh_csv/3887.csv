A,"Yeah,",,,
A,one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from?  Or sources.,,,
B,"I, you know, I assume,  that  the major sources are cars and factories.",,,

A,They have offices that are too well insulated.,,,
A,"They found people are getting sick,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,but I  don't know if that affects outside.,,,
A,"You know, I, I think, seems to think, seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside",,,
A,"and the thing I can, the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Um, I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, um, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which,  has  been a real problem.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it?",,,

A,"Yeah,",,,
A,that's,,,

B,"and I think it will, uh, continue to force us to clean up our act,  literally  and figuratively.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,

A,I think it will.,,,
B,"In Los Angeles they're apparently going to,",,,
B,"they've passed laws that, for habit, do you think this could possibly be prohibit? nothing elseseems to make any sense?? for example, people using, uh, barbecues *listen for habit prohibit gasoline lawn mowers, um,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles,",,,
B,"and, it's gotten bad in Denver",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.",,,
B,"And people in this country are really wedded to their, uh, cars,",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"and our  economy seems to,",,,
B,"and this I think is one of the big problems,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"we have to drive  so far,",,,
A,"but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts,",,,
A,but we're even getting it here.,,,
A,"We can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas",,,
A,and you can tell it in the mornings too.,,,
A,My husband likes to go out and jog,,,
A,and there's just a brown fog here,,,
A,"and we don't even have any mountains that are,  holding it in.",,,

B,Well that makes a lot of sense.,,,
B,"I mean I, I hadn't thought about it that way",,,
B,"but it, it,",,,

A,we can comment,,,
A,and we didn't see this a few years ago.,,,
B,"No,",,,
B,"and I think,",,,
A,It was pretty  clear here.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"and I think that, that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts,  and that  there is a, a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it, it's going to tell us about it,",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"and, uh, we're going to feel it,",,,
B,"and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy,  uh, in this  country, uh, whether people are willing to get out of their cars,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"and  in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable.",,,
B,"For example,  taxing  people heavily for using their cars.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using",,,
B,and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive,,,
B,"but I think, uh, we're going to have to make some fundamental changes",,,
B,"and, and I'm, I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and,  houses  we sell.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car, just one person in that.",,,
A,It's a lot of waste,,,
A,"but,",,,
