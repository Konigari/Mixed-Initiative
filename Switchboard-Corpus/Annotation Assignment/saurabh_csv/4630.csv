A,"but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever.",,,
A,We get our weekly news around the area,,,
A,"and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state",,,

A,"and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock",,,
A,"so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever.",,,

B,"Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, uh,",,,
