A,"And,",,,
B,"Oh, why  yeah.",,,
B,I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.,,,
A,Yes.,,,
A,"And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh,",,,

A,but that wouldn't work for him.,,,

A,Yeah.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.",,,

B,And that's the sad part about it.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,

A,and I think a lot of people who do it now.,,,
A,In Colorado it's interesting.,,,
A,I talked to my mother.,,,
A,They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.,,,
A,And my mother could make it on that.,,,
A,What she probably would do is disburse the money to me,,,
A,and then I would send it back to her,,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,I think that's what most people do.,,,
B,"You just have to give it, everything away.",,,

A,and he's still living at home,,,
A,and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.,,,
B,"Oh, I know.",,,
A,"And so, it's kind of,",,,
A,"you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,",,,
A,"but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older.",,,
A,"Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.",,,
