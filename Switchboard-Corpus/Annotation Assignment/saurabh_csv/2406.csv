B,right.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"our movies today, it used to be X",,,

A,"It's just, uh,",,,
A,"and it's a matter of your taste, uh,",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,

B,"yeah,",,,
B,"it's just that the rating system seems, you know, instead of having X now, they have what, N C seventeen?",,,

B,"It was, it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.",,,
