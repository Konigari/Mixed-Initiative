A,"Well, hi.",,,
A,"I guess, uh, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, uh, a gourmet club here. Um, which means that we have like eight, eight people, four couples.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And most of the husbands,",,,
A,"this is really peculiar,",,,
A,most of the husbands cook.,,,
B,Great.,,,
A,"I mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day.",,,
A,"Um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,",,,
A,but it was the guys that got together and did all this.,,,
B,"Oh, that's nice.",,,
A,"And, um, like my husband just, he really, really likes to cook in terms of, um, oh, barbecue,",,,
A,"and I mean all guys, I think, like to barbecue.",,,
A,"I think it's caveman,",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,right.,,,
A,"I'm telling you,",,,
A,"but, um, he really does cook",,,
A,"and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't, you can't knock that.",,,
B,No.,,,
A,"But all these other guys do too,",,,
A,and so we've gotten together,,,
A,and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.,,,
A,"And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do.",,,
A,"You,",,,
B,How often do you meet?,,,
A,"Well, we try,",,,
A,"I mean, because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that.",,,
A,"It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well",,,
B,"Oh, yes,",,,
B,yes.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids. Um,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"then we would, we tried to do it every other month,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,but lately it's just been once every six months,,,
B,Oh.,,,
B,"Well, that's much more reasonable.",,,
B,"I was involved in a, a club like that for, um, that, you know, where we tried to really do gourmet, uh, meals.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, we, we were a little bit too frequent I think.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,I don't remember if we were once a month,,,
B,"or anyway it was, it was difficult.",,,
B,"By the time we went around it was, uh, four couples",,,
B,"so, uh, by the time we got around, uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost tired, you know. Um, partly because, um, gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining.",,,
A,"Really,",,,
A,really,,,
B,It's too rich.,,,
A,"Oh, it is absolutely.",,,
B,"And, so, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day.",,,
A,Yeah,,,
B,"Um, so, uh, we, we kind of,",,,
B,"and then one of the couples, uh, moved",,,
B,"and so we sort of didn't, didn't continue it,",,,
B,"but, um, and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as much time for, uh, regular entertaining,",,,
B,"but, um, uh, uh, when, when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, um, kind of good for everybody",,,
B,"and that's, that sometimes means you can't do gourmet, because depending on who your guests are.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
A,"Well, yeah,",,,
A,that's true.,,,
A,And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish,,,
A,"so I mean he can get within,",,,
B,"Oh, yeah,",,,
B,"well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.",,,
A,"Oh, my.",,,
B,"Uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.",,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,"Uh, well, I take that back.",,,
B,"Uh, she can't eat some cream cheese.",,,
B,"But that, that really limits,",,,
A,It sure,,,
B,"um,",,,
A,"it makes you, uh, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like,",,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"So we, we try to keep all that in mind,",,,
A,"but otherwise, um, I guess, you know, entertaining, um,",,,
A,"I, I guess I have recipes",,,
A,"I, um,",,,
A,"but that's, that's basically what we do is the gourmet,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Um, but it's fun.",,,
A,"I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,",,,
B,"Oh, wow.",,,
A,"and, you know, you get all prepared",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,but you're right.,,,
A,"It's very, very rich",,,

B,"Um, in spite of, uh,",,,
B,"or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.",,,
