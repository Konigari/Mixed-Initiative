B,one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective.,,,

B,"So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines",,,

B,"and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines.",,,
B,"Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is",,,
