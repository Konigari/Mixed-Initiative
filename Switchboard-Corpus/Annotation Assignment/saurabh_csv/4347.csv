B,and it shrinks too much,,,
B,"and say, well, I should have known better,",,,
B,"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's",,,
A,Um.,,,

B,"But, uh, they, uh,",,,
B,"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff.",,,

B,really.,,,
A,"But, uh, that's the way it is.",,,

A,"I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,

A,"I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there.",,,
A,"There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars.",,,

A,that's just it.,,,

B,The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.,,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time.",,,

A,"Uh,",,,
B,"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail .",,,

A,"Right,",,,
A,"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know.",,,

B,"Really,",,,
B,"why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price.",,,
A,"Yeah, you know.",,,
B,They'd sell more if they were honest.,,,
A,"Exactly,",,,
A,"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both",,,
