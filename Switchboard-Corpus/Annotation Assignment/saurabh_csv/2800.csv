B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes.",,,

A,"Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card.",,,

B,"We just, uh, quit using them",,,

B,but other than that we don't use them anymore,,,
A,"Well, that's kind of the way we were doing",,,
A,"it's, uh,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"I guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing, it's just too much by the time you get,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.,,,
B,"I know,",,,
B,isn't that funny?,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"And I give them,",,,
A,"maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid",,,

A,"know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent.",,,
A,"Sometimes, it's twenty-two percent interest.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Huh.,,,
A,"there's no,",,,
B,Huh?,,,
A,"with the American Express card from T I, there's no, um, late fee,",,,
B,Uh-huh .,,,
A,"there's no, uh, interest rate,",,,
B,"Oh, really?",,,
A,you you either pay the thing off,,,
A,or they come get it.,,,
A,And it's turned into personnel,,,
A,and they come get you,,,
A,"So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then,  some  of the others do.",,,
B,"Oh,  yeah.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to.",,,
A,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,"Oh, you can?",,,
A,"You can use it like any other card,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and, uh, but, it, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month,",,,
B,"Oh, I see, huh.",,,
A,"and who knows how many people, are looking at those, uh, bills that come in, and those statements,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,

A,"is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,",,,

A,"I've got three card offers now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, Visa Gold and, uh, some, other bank, uh,",,,

B,"Oh, I do too,",,,
B,"I don't even open them much,",,,
B,I throw them out.,,,
A,I don't want to have to mess with it.,,,

A,"and, uh, one of these days it's going to all be full.",,,

A,"Oh, that's not bad.",,,
B,shoot I need one of those,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"No,",,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and then they started charging, uh, annual membership fees,",,,
A,"and I said, adios, I'm, you know, I'm not paying you,",,,
B,Why do they do that?,,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,There's going to be that much more.,,,

B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card,",,,
A,"so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, I, it would be okay,",,,
