B,Right.,,,
A,"Uh, sometimes when I hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, uh, I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them, uh,",,,

A,"When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much, it's just billions of dollars",,,
A,"that's, I think is just being thrown away.",,,

B,right.,,,
B,"And then when you read about that they're spending all the money on, you know, these studies that have no relevance whatsoever, that kind of ticks you off, too.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"But, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.",,,

B,"well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government.",,,
B,"I just, you know,",,,
B,"I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,",,,
B,"and you're out, you know.",,,
B,"I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,",,,
B,"but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it.",,,
B,"Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.",,,
B,"And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here",,,
A,and you,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,so.,,,
A,"Gas, I don't know about you guys,",,,

A,"And you don't realize,",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,we got a sales tax.,,,
B,"Our sales tax is like eight percent,",,,
B,and I don't know what our gas tax is.,,,
B,I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"So. I mean, they're hitting us up,",,,
B,"and they may not raise it, you know, federally as much one year,",,,
B,but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.,,,
B,"It's just, I mean, you can see that your money is just not going that far.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,"Well, I know they say like with Reagan, they say no new taxes,",,,
A,"but they changed the, uh, deductions on you,",,,
A,"and that just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different way",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"so, I mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,"well, I mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have left over,",,,
B,"and all of a sudden, I don't know it's just, it's eating me alive.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I heard someone say that, uh, if they would just, something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,",,,
