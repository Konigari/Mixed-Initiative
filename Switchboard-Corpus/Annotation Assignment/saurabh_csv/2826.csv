A,"I think the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when, when I'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family.",,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh, and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and, uh, support for young people that the kind of support that they need,  to help  them take care of the things,",,,
B,"Yes,",,,
B,"and,",,,
A,"if you don't have some kind of, of basic believe or something down inside of you,  then  it's very difficult to, uh, have anything to turn to,  when you  got, when you've got something facing you like that.",,,

A,No.,,,
A,That's right.,,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"and  you're, you get mixed signals",,,

A,"No,",,,
A,"there's so much  more, then that",,,
A,"it starts, very much deeper then that",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,I think that too.,,,
A,"I see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,",,,
B,No .,,,
A,"but  whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know,",,,
A,"it's just,",,,
B,"Of course, life is a lot more complicated too in ways, um,",,,
B,"the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained,  for  now.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"Uh, you know, with farming being so mechanized,  uh,  people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely,",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"factory jobs are so much more, um, uh, sophisticated.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,that's right.,,,

B,"it, it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force",,,
B,"and,  some  people just don't have it.",,,
A,Right.,,,
A,"And there's so much, so, so many people on the lower end of those who, who are going to be the, the drop outs and the,  and the poor and  the homeless and whatnot,",,,
B,"And you worry when,  you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children,",,,

B,"uh, in terms of  what it's going to mean to a society,  in  the future it's a",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"some ways it's rather frightening,",,,
A,It really is,,,

B,It certainly is.,,,
B,"Well, it sure is.",,,
B,It sure is.,,,
A,"Uh, not that I really think that they were perfect ten, twenty, or thirty years ago,",,,
A,"but,",,,
B,It was a little easier though wasn't it?,,,
A,"Uh, yeah,",,,
A,"just the volume makes a big difference,",,,
B,Yes.,,,
A,"I  think as, uh, as, uh, mother you know, I use to think sometimes it's not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids,",,,
A,"it's just the volume of it,  to  try to keep all wash done and all the things done and, you know, and everything.",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"uh,  I look at my mother's life",,,
B,"I mean she, she didn't work, um, um,",,,
B,for a long time when I was very young she didn't drive.,,,
B,"Uh, she learned to drive I think when I was, um, a teenager,",,,
B,"and her life was a lot simpler,",,,
A,"Right and,  and children's lives were simpler because mother was there,",,,
B,"and I  sit here,",,,
A,somebody was there.,,,
B,That's right.,,,
A,"And, and when there's nobody there,",,,
B,"That's right,",,,
B,that's right.,,,
A,"I always thought too  that, you know, people worrying about going to work when their child, when their children are little",,,
A,"and I, and I think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much,",,,
A,"but I, I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go,  to go work was when they were  teenagers.",,,
B,They need you more as a teenager .,,,
B,Isn't that true.,,,
B,That's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home.,,,
B,"Um,",,,
A,"Right,",,,
A,"it's not so much that they come to you every minute,",,,
A,but it's that you are there when they need you.,,,
B,That's,,,
B,"isn't that,",,,
B,"that's so true,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"uh,  uh, I find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,and  it keeps me from being the old fogy,,,
B,"so, but at the same time,  it  also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes,",,,
A,"Yes,",,,
A,I think that's true.,,,
B,as to what's,,,
B,but that's  the same,,,
B,"I'm home in the summers,",,,
B,"I'm home with the holidays,",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"that's,",,,

B,"or where home,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"one  is now a senior in high school and the other's in college,",,,
A,"Well,",,,
B,"and,  uh,",,,
A,"But that helps a lot,",,,
B,"It's, uh, it, uh, it does,",,,
A,"I have a daughter who just  had a second job,",,,
A,she needed to work,,,
A,"and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her. And, uh, and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them,",,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,uh-huh.,,,
B,That's right.,,,
A,"and, uh,  and so I,",,,
A,", you know, good kind of experience as well",,,
A,"but, uh,",,,
B,"Well I,",,,
A,I think  that's really important,,,
A,I don't think people realize how important it is.,,,
B,"That's, that is, that is so true,",,,
A,"Yeah, uh,",,,
B,and it's  not that always that the children always say something,,,
B,"but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"and  you realize it's important that, uh,",,,
B,"and yet, you know, we have to make that choice",,,
B,"I think twenty, thirty years ago a lot of women,  just  didn't have to make that choice.",,,
