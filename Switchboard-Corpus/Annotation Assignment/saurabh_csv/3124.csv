B,"Uh, I forget the, the county,",,,

A,"Okay,",,,
A,sort of.,,,
B,I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.,,,
B,It was real close to where I worked.,,,
B,It was only like four miles to work,,,
B,and it was wonderful being on the lake like that.,,,
B,"You know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake",,,
B,"and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,",,,
B,"and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,",,,
B,you could still kind of go sledding and such out there,,,
B,but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes.,,,
B,There's lots of really small ones out there.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"You know, like maybe a mile, two long.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"That's enough to, uh, do some boating",,,
A,That's right.,,,
B,and it was lots of fun.,,,
A,"That's right. Which is,",,,
B,Um.,,,
A,"well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor,",,,

A,but that's the only one I probably could name after all these years,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"so, But, uh,",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
B,"But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes",,,
B,"and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake,",,,
B,but I just thought that was grand.,,,
B,"And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,",,,
B,but there was quite a few lakes all around there.,,,
B,"It seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island",,,
B,there was so much water around where I was.,,,
B,"I said I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac,",,,
B,"I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits",,,
B,and it was really nice out there.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"We had, uh, Pine Knob you know, to go skiing and stuff.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,Right.,,,
A,Right.,,,
B,So there were things around there.,,,
B,Really was pretty nice.,,,
A,"Sure,",,,
A,"sure,",,,
A,"and isn't that where they have a summer music festival there, too?",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,right,,,
B,in the summertime they have musicals there,,,
B,and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope.,,,
A,"That's right,",,,
A,that's right.,,,
A,"I know, we used to,",,,
A,"we, we didn't do a lot of it,",,,
A,"but we did. We did,",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,so those are always fun.,,,
A,"And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to, It was nice.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,uh-huh.,,,
A,"I always tell people that in the winter we use, we used to, uh,",,,
A,"my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.",,,
B,"Oh, yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"So but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,",,,
A,"but then it chipped, chipped",,,
A,"and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven",,,
A,"so,",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
B,We used to have a,,,
B,"Christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from Alabama,",,,
B,and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas,,,
B,and the kids when they were young would just go nuts.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"You know, because they were from Alabama where it never snowed",,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it, you know, eternally.",,,
A,Oh.,,,
A,"Oh, right,",,,
A,right.,,,
A,"If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time.",,,
B,"My first winter here,",,,
B,"I, I came down in, uh, early eighty-two",,,
B,and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December couple days before Christmas.,,,
B,"It lasted only a few hours,",,,
B,like by noon it was gone.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go to work because the roads are all, you know, snow",,,
B,"And I was laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke,",,,
B,ha ha.,,,
B,"They said, no really, there's snow",,,
B,"and there was, but a very short time",,,
B,and the weather got warm so quick,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,it just melted it all away.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"yeah,",,,
A,I know.,,,
B,"Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun.",,,
A,"No,",,,
A,"that's not fun either,",,,
A,"so, uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets",,,
A,"so, But, uh, well we have,",,,
A,"our house is kind of on a little hill,",,,
A,"so, uh, we get the sled out",,,
A,"and, uh, the kids go down the the hill on the sleds when it's icy,",,,
A,I mean they just go down the ice.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.",,,
A,I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there.,,,
B,"Oh, yeah.",,,
B,"I think it's fun,",,,
B,even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit.,,,
B,"I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad,",,,
B,"but if you get on the, the, uh, grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, you know, not slip and fall.",,,
B,"I mean, first,",,,
