B,Why don't you go ahead and start.,,,
A,"Okay,",,,
A,"well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,",,,
A,"and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,

A,"Oh, they are.",,,
A,"My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE",,,

A,Yes,,,
B,they're always getting something in the mail,,,
B,"and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,",,,
B,"and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,",,,
B,"but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,",,,
B,"unless you just want to skim through while you're,",,,
