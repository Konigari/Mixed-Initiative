B,"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues.",,,

B,Yeah.,,,
B,"I mean, you don't have to ...",,,
A,That's one of our favorites,,,

A,"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,

A,"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?",,,
A,"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those.",,,

B,Huh-uh.,,,
A,"That is, it's, it's really funny.",,,

A,"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night.",,,
A,"Uh, but it's,",,,
A,we've only seen it a couple of times.,,,
A,"But it, it's real,",,,
A,"the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five,",,,
A,"and I can't remember what day they call it,",,,
A,"but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff",,,
B,"Oh, great.",,,
A,"Anyway Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,",,,
A,"and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,",,,
A,"and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her.",,,
B,Oh.,,,
A,"And she said no,",,,
A,"you can't do, you know,",,,
A,"he ran her out, was running to in a wheelchair to hide her,",,,
A,"and she said, ""You can't do that.""",,,
B,Huh.,,,
A,"""This is tradition.",,,
A,"This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff.""",,,
A,"And, uh, he said, ""I don't understand.""",,,
A,"It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, the the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, ""No, you can't do it,"" and then, and then, uh, ""Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,""",,,
A,"and the son was, you know, ""Why?""",,,
A,"And so, in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"Oh, he doesn't.",,,
A,"and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it.",,,
A,"And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,",,,
A,"they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and they all go out and howl, you know",,,

A,"He, he did,",,,
A,he thought it was not ...,,,
B,So he didn't go howl?,,,

A,"he wouldn't go howl,",,,
A,"so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him",,,
B,"Oh, how funny.",,,
A,It is.,,,
A,"It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,",,,
A,"and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them.",,,
B,Huh.,,,
A,"So it's,",,,
A,"our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it.",,,
A,"But it really is, it moves real fast.",,,
A,"It's a real short,",,,
A,"and there's always, like I say, a moral to it",,,
A,"and,",,,
B,"It's just a half hour,",,,
B,or is it hour?,,,
A,"Well, half hour.",,,
