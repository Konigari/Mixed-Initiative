B,just recently I got married,,,
B,and we bought a house.,,,
B,We're about fifty yards from the golf course,,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,but unfortunately the house is taking up my time.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"So it's been, uh, it's been almost a year, I guess, since I've actually, uh, swung a club for a purpose.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I I haven't played in about two years,",,,
A,and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here.,,,
A,I work at T I.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"And I played in a tournament out there,",,,
A,and I shot a net fifty-nine.,,,
A,"They were kind of, little upset.",,,
A,I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"I have a hard time inventing shots, you know.",,,
A,"Let's go around this tree, and you know, try a slice through a hook here,",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,and I can't do that,,,
A,so.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"I finally got out,",,,
A,and I've been watching quite a few videos.,,,
A,I had not been able to play,,,
A,"so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while,",,,
A,"and I, I hope I'm on the right track.",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"Shot a career low eighty-nine, so, and my handicap is twenty nine.",,,
B,"That's, that's great.",,,
A,I like that.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
B,"Now it's, uh, like I say, it's been a while for me, too.",,,
B,"I, uh, I've got my wife motivated about it, um",,,
A,Really.,,,
B,"and, uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs",,,
B,"and, uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built up",,,
B,"and hopefully we can, uh, we can start in.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"I've tried to get my wife,",,,
A,I bought her a set of clubs four years ago.,,,
A,"She hasn't even swung them,",,,
A,"but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day,",,,
B,Really.,,,
A,"she's she's ready to get off into it,",,,
B,"Well, great, great.",,,
B,"That's good,",,,
A,"but, you know, I like, I just like getting out, being in the outdoors,",,,
A,"and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway,",,,
A,"but, you know.",,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,same thing here.,,,
A,"You know, at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf",,,
A,"and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really.",,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,right.,,,
A,"And I, you know, I walk,",,,
A,I don't ride,,,
A,so,,,
B,"Uh-huh,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"you know, I get a little exercise there, too,",,,
A,so.,,,
B,"That's,",,,
B,I've got the same attitude.,,,
B,"I, uh, I tell you,",,,
B,"I started,",,,
B,"I guess, the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when I was in college.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, I took, uh, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while,",,,
B,"and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was still in school",,,
A,Right.,,,
B,"and since then, uh, we've made it, um,",,,
B,"as, as the friends start getting married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, uh, having a, a Thursday, um,",,,
B,"well, have, have probably like, like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"And, uh, so, it,",,,
B,that's back in South Dakota where I grew up,,,
A,Oh.,,,
B,"and, uh, so that, that's, uh, that's been my main, my main involvement,",,,
B,"is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here,",,,
B,"but, uh eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,it's pretty nice.,,,
A,We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not.,,,
A,They were amazed.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"You know, here it is, sixty-five degrees,",,,
A,"we're out playing golf,",,,
A,"and they're freezing cold back there,",,,
A,"so. But, I, uh, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, you know,",,,
B,"Yep,",,,
B,yep.,,,
A,when I got into the service I got into it,,,
B,"Oh, okay.",,,
A,"and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go,",,,
A,"and then one, one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf.",,,
A,"And I said, Well, yeah, you know,",,,
A,"I've got my clubs,",,,
A,but I haven't swung them in quite a few years.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"And then I got into it and then back out of it,",,,
A,and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,that's right.,,,
A,"You know, I really enjoy it.",,,
A,It's really nice.,,,
B,"Oh, it is, it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's, uh, that's got the same level of interest.",,,
B,That seem to be the hardest thing.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"Well, about,",,,
B,"that's, that's true of any sport, you know.",,,
B,"If you want to play tennis, or racquetball,",,,
A,Yeah,,,
A,"you don't want to go out and get beat to death,",,,
A,but.,,,
B,"Right,",,,
B,"and, and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time, you know",,,
A,No.,,,
B,"and, and, uh,",,,
A,"And then, you know, we've got some guys here that they are, you know, four and five handicappers",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them,",,,
A,"so. You know, but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time.",,,
B,Right.,,,
B,"That's right,",,,
B,yeah.,,,
A,"And I've, you know, I've",,,
A,"never, never yet have I walked up,",,,
A,"now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with,",,,
A,and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.,,,
B,That's true.,,,
A,They are always friendly.,,,
B,That's true.,,,
A,"Sure, come on out, you know,",,,
A,"and they don't mind if you make a mistake,",,,
A,"they don't mind saying, Well, you know, let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or,",,,
B,Well.,,,
A,"You know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there",,,
B,"That, that's, that's so.",,,
A,and you can't find that in all sports.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"that's absolutely right,",,,
B,"and you can gain a lot of ground doing that, too, if you, if, you know,",,,
B,"you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot",,,
B,"but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything.",,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
B,"After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer,",,,
B,then you've basically tapped your resources there.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"you need to,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"But, uh, I'd like to, uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that.",,,
A,"Oh yeah,",,,
A,"we , we have one down here in the summertime.",,,
A,"Uh, it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
B,Right.,,,
A,And we play in the summertime out here.,,,
A,"We get a mixed league in,",,,
A,and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for.,,,
A,"It's going to start, well, when we change time back whenever that is next month, I guess,",,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"and it will start then,",,,
A,"and, you know, we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago,",,,
A,"and they were just starting to learn,",,,
A,"and, you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty",,,
B,Sure.,,,
A,"but they were, you know,",,,
A,"now they're down into the hundreds nineties,",,,
B,Right.,,,
A,"so, it won't take her long. You know,",,,
B,"Well, that's good that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun.",,,
A,"And it's something we can do together,",,,
A,"so. Well, she doesn't do much hunting,",,,
A,she could care less about that.,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"She's does a little fishing,",,,
A,"but, you know, golf would give her the exercise,",,,
A,"she'd be outside,",,,
A,"give her something to do that we both enjoy,",,,
A,so.,,,
B,"Yeah,",,,
B,"it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"I, I, I go home, uh, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting,",,,
B,"and, uh um, the, the last time I, I took my wife along",,,
A,Uh-huh.,,,
B,"and, uh, kind of the same situation.",,,
B,"She's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff,",,,
B,"but, She'll definitely, uh, she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along,",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"but, uh it's, it's interesting,",,,
A,All right.,,,
A,"Yeah,",,,
A,"and it's, you know, it's a game that you don't,",,,
A,"like bowling, you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred.",,,
A,"But if you shoot a hundred in golf, you know,",,,
A,"you don't have to be an expert to play,",,,
B,That's right.,,,
A,Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"So, you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all.",,,
B,"That's right,",,,
B,"well, yeah,",,,
B,"I've, I've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if I could just, if I could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"and then, and I keep, I keep rationalizing that well, you know, I can do it,",,,
B,"I just got to do it all at on the same hole,",,,
B,"and, and then it will get better,",,,
B,"and you just keep going,",,,
B,"and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing.",,,
A,Yeah.,,,
B,"It, it, it really works that way",,,
A,"And when, you know when I first got back into it, I used to get mad because I knew I could do something",,,
A,and I didn't get it done.,,,
B,Uh-huh.,,,
A,"You know,",,,
A,"and I just, well, I need to slice this ball around here,",,,
A,"I naturally slice anyway,",,,
A,"now you know, the ball will go straight",,,
A,and I go,,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"but, you know I'd get upset about it sometimes,",,,
B,Yeah.,,,
A,"and now I guess, you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit.",,,
B,Sure.,,,
A,I don't get upset any more.,,,
A,"So, and,",,,
B,Sure.,,,
B,"And well, that's great.",,,
A,"Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.",,,
B,"Well, you bet.",,,
A,I guess I'll go back to work.,,,
B,"Okay,",,,
B,sounds like it.,,,
A,All right.,,,
A,See you later .,,,
B,Okay.,,,
A,Bye-bye.,,,
B,Bye.,,,
