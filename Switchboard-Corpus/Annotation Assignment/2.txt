1 Uh-huh.
2 and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,
3 Yeah
4 well, I know out in some,
5 I'm not sure,
6 I can't remember the name of the county
7 it's, it's where Stillwater is or, sweet,
8 Yeah.
9 no
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I'm not sure,
2 I know it,
3 I think it's, uh,
4 I know we have a piece property there,
5 it's called Dublin,
6 Uh-huh.
7 it's in Dublin, Texas.
8 I'm not really sure what the county,
9 it's Stephen,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 no
2 Stephenville.
3 Oh, okay,
4 okay.
5 Okay,
6 where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, um, introduced a lot of dairies there,
7 Uh-huh.
8 Yeah.
9 so, they have a lot of cattle in the area,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I mean, they've got like per, per, uh, per lot,
2 you know, they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't
3 it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,
4 Right,
5 uh-huh.
6 they've got to have them there to be able to milk them.
7 And they,
8 and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow produces, like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.
9 Oh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 One cow,
2 I was like, my God,
3 and they,
4 and this thing says that, that, you know, people think, well, cow manure is good for fertilizer
5 but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not, it's not
6 when, you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it
7 and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down,
8 Uh-huh.
9 and, and this, and this article said that they've got a real problem that, um, you've got toxins and, and, uh, bacteria in the manure that is,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 what it's doing is it's going through, uh,
2 they don't have a very deep, um,
3 you know, their water, their natural water, uh,
4 Uh-huh.
5 I forget what that's called with, you know,
6 it's like a spring, spring water,
7 Yeah.
8 but it's below the surface
9 it's not very far down,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,
3 Oh.
4 and they're like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, their they're water in that town will be totally polluted,
5 It will.
6 and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,
7 Uh-huh,
8 yeah,
9 and the
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and I'm like my God, you know, just from that one, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.
2 Right.
3 Right.
4 Yeah,
5 and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.
6 No,
7 not when you figure,
8 I didn't realize a cow, one cow produces that much manure
9 and they were talking like, thousands of cows, you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 These are well fed .
2 These are,
3 You,
4 Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh,
5 Well, they are evidently.
6 But, um, I mean, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,
7 Uh-huh.
8 but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but when they get them in these tiny little areas, you know, and they've got a real big problem,
2 and they, they said that, that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, uh, these like ponds that they had to filter it with,
3 Uh-huh.
4 but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow
5 Yeah.
6 and they overflow into the, the creeks and stuff in the area.
7 So, that just creates,
8 you know, there, there's,
9 and, oh, it was just disgusting
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 it said the creeks will foam.
2 Oh.
3 People, people stand outside their houses and their, watch the creeks foam brown and all,
4 Oh, now that's bad.
5 and I'm just like, oh, my gosh,
6 and the smell is really bad they
7 Oh, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.
8 Yeah,
9 but I, I don't know
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 it really frightens me though as far as the, when you think about the, you know, thinking of just air pollution itself
2 and then, and, channel thirteen they're really, um, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,
3 Uh-huh.
4 if we, if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for, um, just the, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at.
5 Yeah.
6 Right,
7 right.
8 And then cutting the trees, you know, that bothers me.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 As far as, you know the
2 The rain forest and all.
3 yes,
4 uh, we've been wanting to,
5 well, not me
6 but, uh, it's been or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here,
7 I'm like, no,
8 you know, for what's cut down here, you know, more will be cut down someplace else
9 and it will just take that longer to grow back,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 and trees help so that, uh,
3 I don't,
4 Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it
5 Uh-huh.
6 and they're synthesizing it for us.
7 Right,
8 right,
9 believe me it's just so much better.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Yeah.
2 So, uh, yeah,
3 I knew,
4 I think there's lots that be, that could be done to, to improve how things are done now.
5 Yeah,
6 I think we just have to,
7 I don't know personally, you know,
8 I suppose, you know, if you just make sure your car is, is working properly
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and
2 you know, they're
3 nowadays they have the emission controls on them
4 but, uh, I think the only, the main thing is just keep on the, your legislator's back, you know, as far as,
5 seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved
6 Uh-huh.
7 it, it's really becoming a problem.
8 By the year two thousand there will,
9 what, what are we going to have,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 what kind of results are we going to have for the environment.
2 Right.
3 And, and what will we ...
1 Okay.
2 Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents?
3 Unfortunately, yes.
4 Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives
5 and we were talking, uh,
6 we had a review with the nursing home staff.
7 My mother's in a nursing home.
8 Uh-huh.
9 And, uh, we had a review today
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing,
2 Yes.
3 so, yes,
4 I'm very familiar with it
5 and it's not something that is, uh, you know,
6 I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience.
7 But I guess we all do.
8 I think sooner or later, uh,
9 both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.
2 Oh, really?
3 And, uh-huh.
4 And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life.
5 Uh-huh.
6 I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.
7 Right.
8 What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?
9 Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 Yes
2 Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around
3 and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area
4 And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like.
5 But, again, it's no different than every one.
6 And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month
7 Um, uh-huh.
8 when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care.
9 Yes.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Yes.
2 It's not that expensive, really.
3 No,
4 uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.
5 Uh-huh.
6 And, uh, theirs both ran,
7 oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred
8 and my mother's was two thousand.
9 Then, this has been five years ago.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And, uh uh, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if,
2 Uh-huh.
3 when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours
4 Uh-huh.
5 and they knew.
6 And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better.
7 Oh, really?
8 You know, uh-huh.
9 And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would,
3 Yeah.
4 and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh,
5 we had my mother all set to go into one
6 and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And, I saw areas that they had not shown me
9 and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I'll be darned.
2 so, uh, we did not put her in that one.
3 We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, uh, better pleased with the situation.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah,
7 you, you know, this is the whole point.
8 You've got, you've got to shop them.
9 Yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 you do.
2 I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's
3 Uh-huh.
4 and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around,
7 but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation.
8 Uh-huh.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 And it's very, very,
2 Does your mother have Alzheimer's?
3 She,
4 well, who knows.
5 They call it, uh, dementia.
6 Uh-huh.
7 And, uh, we don't know.
8 I, I mean she does not know us anymore
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows,
2 Uh-huh.
3 but it's, basically the same.
4 And her health is not that bad.
5 Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last,
6 well, she had been in a retirement community
7 and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.
8 Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in,
2 and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months.
1 Okay
2 what, do you do artistic painting?
3 Uh, I do tole painting.
4 Oh, you do?
5 Uh-huh,
6 I really love the tole painting.
7 Uh, I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor.
8 I would like to learn that someday,
9 but right now my passion is tole painting
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Do you do a lot of it?
2 Uh-huh.
3 I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago
4 and I've done a little, uh,
5 Oh.
6 But it takes a lot of time
7 It does,
8 it is real time consuming
9 and,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 do you sell your projects?
2 Uh, mostly I have just given them away as gifts.
3 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, I've done, uh, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, oh, on and on, you know, just things like that,
5 but uh, I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
6 Uh-huh.
7 Where do you work at?
8 I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden
9 so,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?
2 No,
3 I've wanted to do that, uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that.
4 Uh-huh.
5 So, I have five children of my own,
6 so it's
7 That keeps you busy.
8 they, they keep me busy
9 and tole painting is just a, you know, something I do in my spare time
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so
2 Uh-huh.
3 Have you tried any of the,
4 well, do you cut out your own projects?
5 Yes,
6 uh-huh,
7 I have my own saws
8 and so I really enjoy doing that.
9 Huh. Do you, uh, ever spray your projects with the, I mean a base coat first
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 or do you brush it on?
2 I brush it on,
3 yeah,
4 I haven't tried a, a spray varnish.
5 I use just a wood sealer.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Yeah.
8 I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.
9 Oh, uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 And I do a lot of woodworking
2 and that's what I bought it for.
3 Do you?
4 Oh.
5 But I haven't used it yet.
6 Oh, well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it?
7 Yeah.
8 Oh.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Now what type of woodworking do you do?
2 Uh, fine furniture.
3 Oh  do you?
4 Yeah.
5 That's why I brought, bought the sprayer is to finish my projects.
6 Oh.
7 That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking.
8 I get so sick of making
9 Oh, but it's hard to finish it, huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah,
2 but spraying does put on a nicer finish.
3 Oh, well, that is interesting.
4 So, what kind of equipment do you have?
5 For woodworking?
6 Uh-huh.
7 Uh, let me see,
8 table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers,
9 and about it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Boy, it sounds like you're really into it.
2 That is nice.
3 Yeah,
4 it is.
5 Yeah,
6 I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
7 and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
8 Yeah,
9 the band saw is really nice.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 I have an Inca.
2 I don't know if you've ever heard of those.
3 Oh.
4 But it's nice to have the right equipment.
5 Yeah,
6 that is, that makes it easier, doesn't it?
7 Uh-huh.
8 Well, have you sold any of your furniture
9 or just,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh
2 not,
3 mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.
4 Uh-huh.
5 But, Making my own furniture.
6 Yeah.
7 Oh, that's interesting.
8 Do you, uh, did you take classes to learn how to do that?
9 Uh, just in junior high
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that.
3 Oh, so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then.
4 Yeah.
5 Oh.
6 Yeah.
7 Well, that is interesting.
8 Oh, I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to.
9 I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but mostly, uh, just do more,
2 Like the shelves and,
3 Uh-huh,
4 the woodworking.
5 For your tole painting.
6 Uh,
7 Yeah
8 Yeah,
9 so, it's fun
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Good.
2 Well I guess I'll let you go now.
3 Well, they come on,
4 we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us
5 Oh, they do?
6 Okay,
7 so this is my first one.
8 You're probably a veteran at this.
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, it has, it has been really fun.
2 I've enjoyed this. Uh,
3 like I say, I've made a couple of calls to Texas, and just talked to all different kinds of people
4 Uh-huh.
5 so I think you'll enjoy doing it.
6 Yeah.
7 It's fun.
8 Sounds fun.
9 Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 Uh, you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love.
2 Uh, and it's there by the, Copper Mill restaurant, used to be the Hayloft.
3 I am not
4 well, we live in Roy
1 Okay,
2 should begin. *listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"
3 Okay.
4 All right.
5 Uh, I can begin this, um,
6 basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
7 Uh-huh.
8 and the, the benefit program we have here is really quite good.
9 I'm, I'm pretty pleased with it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 They cover, uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical
2 Uh-huh.
3 uh, you name it,
4 and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much,
5 so I'm pretty satisfied myself.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Um, what's your situation?
8 I work for the University of New Hampshire,
9 and uh, our benefits package isn't, uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. Uh, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh.
2 overall I'm satisfied with it.
3 We don't have the vision care,
4 we do have the health care and the, uh, and the or the dental.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Uh.
7 Are you a professor there?
8 No,
9 I work in, I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 and I, effectively I run the telephone switch at, uh, at the University of New Hampshire.
2 Oh, I see,
3 okay.
4 Uh, so the, uh, the benefits,
5 uh, probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.
6 Oh, no doubt
7 We get fifteen days a year sick time,
8 and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Well, that's good.
2 Yeah.
3 Yeah,
4 that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is, uh,
5 I used to work with the Army Research Institute,
6 and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.
7 Right.
8 But here you don't get that.
9 You maybe get two or three a year.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Uh-huh.
2 So it's really,
3 unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.
4 Uh-huh.
5 So, that's, that's kind of a drawback I think.
6 But, uh. I don't know.
7 What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of, of the different benefits?
8 Well, I think, uh, the, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and, uh, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, uh you know,
2 Yeah.
3 I'm, I'm a little disturbed about that,
4 but I think that's a national trend,
5 and I don't know that, uh, I don't know what the solution is to it.
6 It's bigger than just the benefits part.
7 Yeah,
8 I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night,
9 they, uh, they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward, uh, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 Right.
3 It's kind of an interesting plan.
4 It's kind of cold though.
5 They've essentially made up a list of, uh, oh, all the different, uh, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff,
6 Oh, yeah.
7 about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by, by, uh, subsidized health care,
8 and the ones above would.
9 Um.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 So it's kind of like drawing this line
2 and, and if you have it great,
3 if you don't, you're kind of out of luck
4 Uh-huh.
5 but, um, it was kind of an interesting show.
6 Um.
7 I think you're right,
8 I think health care is probably the, the most pressing uh, the pressing one,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 but I'll tell you, I, I don't mind having dental, you know,
2 sometimes dental costs can be, um, just about as expensive, if not more,
3 and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
4 Uh-huh.
5 but I'm not sure that's, that's widely followed any more.
6 I'm not sure,
7 how, how does, uh, University of New Hampshire handle it?
8 Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, uh, depending,
9 and, and the cost between them is very, is very little.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think it costs me something like five dollars a, a month for the dental plan.
2 Um.
3 But it pays, uh, a substantial amount.
4 I mean, the examinations and, and, uh, checkups every year, or every six months are free
5 Great.
6 and, uh, it, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.
7 Is that, uh, let me interrupt, is that the same for both, uh, professors and, and also staff and administration,
8 is that generally across the board, do you think
9 or,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 Uh, yes,
2 it is.
3 The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff, which I belong to
4 Right.
5 Uh-huh.
6 but the main,
7 I think the, the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.
8 But the main difference is in the, uh, the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, okay.
2 Uh, for the operating staff it's on a seniority, it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.
3 Right.
4 That determines how much, uh, vacation time they get.
5 Yeah,
6 I'm kind of interested because I'm actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to, uh, is to teach in a university.
7 Uh-huh.
8 Uh-huh.
1 Arlington, Texas
2 now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day
3 Is that right?
4 Yeah.
5 Well, I never thought about that,
6 but there is an Arlington,
7 like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan you know,
8 Oh
9 and I was thinking yeah, and I was thinking
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Birmingham.
2 the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.
3 Right.
4 It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country.
5 Yeah,
6 well, tell me what kind of books have you read?
7 Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years
8 so mainly, text books.
9 I was going to say, not fun kind, right?
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 No, um,
2 but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones
3 Uh-huh.
4 but, you know, sometimes
5 I just read one about Grace Kelley.
6 I love to read about real people.
7 To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories
8 Yeah,
9 it is,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing.
2 Yeah,
3 it happened.
4 You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.
5 Really?
6 Yeah,
7 that was real good.
8 I'm like you,
9 if it's not a heavy biography, you know I enjoy it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Right.
2 I used to like to read about royalty a lot.
3 I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe.
4 That was my thing for a while.
5 I was trying to think, uh,
6 I read a, uh, a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all,
7 and there was a murder.
8 Oh, really.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 it was some time ago.
2 Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that.
3 Oh, it sounds like fun.
4 It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.
5 Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know
6 Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.
7 Yeah,
8 in fact I believe it was
9 because,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Really?
2 Uh-huh.
3 I believe.
4 Sounds like something she would write.
5 Yeah,
6 I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me,
7 and I thought, well, this will be great,
8 and it was.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I've heard that she's done you know, her books are really interesting,
2 and they always sell well.
3 Uh-huh.
4 And, uh,
5 Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, you know.
6 Yeah,
7 brings it to life.
8 I know, uh, the some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, you know.
2 I know,
3 our movie stars.
4 Our movie stars,
5 because it's totally different concept to us.
6 Oh, right.
7 I haven't, I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either.
8 I have read, uh, mostly novels.
9 I went to visit my daughter in Florida
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 Um.
2 and I took a novel with me, uh, and read it at Thanksgiving time,
3 and, uh, it was, uh, one of those generation novels, you know
4 Oh, yes.
5 starts out when they're small and continues through generations
6 Oh, I always like those.
7 and I like that.
8 Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch?
9 Yes,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I have.
2 Isn't she fabulous?
3 Oh, she is wonderful.
4 Oh, once you
5 I don't like to get one of her books
6 because, I, I just live to read.
7 I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to the book
8 I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I I could not put it down.
9 Oh, yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 She's just a,
2 I don't know,
3 does she, how often does she come out with them.
4 I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.
5 Well, no,
6 it seems like she doesn't write as often as, oh, well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things.
7 She writes the same thing.
8 Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.
9 Yeah,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and, and they're the same silly things,
2 I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's, It, it's practically the same thing over and over, you know.
3 Yeah,
4 I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think.
5 And think how rich she is.
6 Yeah,
7 wouldn't I, you know,
8 I'm criticizing her,
9 and wouldn't I like to have her money
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 because they go from hardback to paperback
3 and she has millions of them.
4 And then make movies out of some of them.
5 Uh-huh.
6 You know, mini series and so forth,
7 and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often.
8 I have not seen as many of hers.
9 Well, hers are so involved,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.
2 Uh-huh.
3 I think she does a lot of research, too.
4 I do too,
5 so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,
6 Huh-uh.
7 but oh, her books are just incredible.
8 I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?
9 No,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I don't think so,
2 and I've often wondered why, haven't you?
3 Yes
4 You know, I,
5 well, no, uh,
6 I really just thought about it now
7 but there's just,
8 Yeah.
9 Maybe it's because they take so much in.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I don't know.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, you know.
4 They're so big
5 Uh-huh.
6 they're such, you know,
7 it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie
8 Yeah.
9 And maybe that turns people off,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.
2 Oh, I know.
3 It's about one of my favorite movies.
4 Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?
5 No,
6 it had such a bad press,
7 I wasn't too .
8 Yeah,
9 that's exactly what I was going to say.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 I was amazed,
2 because I,
3 in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad,
4 Uh-huh.
1 Okay,
2 what kind of house do you live in?
3 Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas
4 and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back
5 and, It's about thirty-five hundred square feet.
6 Uh-huh.
7 Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.
8 I live in one,
9 I don't have a swimming pool.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.
2 Yeah.
3 But the four bedrooms
4 and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike.
5 I think it's pretty much typical for this area.
6 It is.
7 Have you been living there very long?
8 I've been in the house
9 I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	7
1 So you've been there longer.
2 We built this one about, uh,
3 it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and we subcontracted it out ourselves.
6 We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
7 Oh, really?
8 Uh-huh.
9 and then we subbed it out,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Well, I bet you,
4 Uh-huh.
5 My husband got his big garage.
6 He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
7 Uh-huh.
8 and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
9 and, so he has all the work space he needs.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Well, that sounds interesting.
2 I bet he's enjoyed having it that way
3 He,
4 because
5 kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.
6 It is,
7 and that's why we decided to build.
8 We looked at things that were already, uh, built
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
2 Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.
3 Uh-huh.
4 They're kind of rare.
5 So we put a three car garage in.
6 Uh-huh.
7 But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.
8 All of it was taken up with just car space.
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Well that,
4 my, we've just got a two car garage,
5 but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
6 Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
7 Now, mine does not work on cars,
8 he just piddles on this and that.
9 Oh, I see.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.
2 Uh-huh.
3 Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
4 It really is.
5 Uh-huh.
6 Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,
7 and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having,
8 and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 but I, someone,
2 I don't know,
3 it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
4 Right.
5 So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.
6 Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
7 Uh-huh.
8 And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.
9 His parents come
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and also the kids have friends who come and stay
2 Uh-huh.
3 and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
4 Uh-huh.
5 Well, I still,
6 all three of my daughters are married,
7 but, I don't know,
8 I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, I understand
2 And we've got grandchildren now,
3 so when they come, they have to have a place.
4 Well, we,
5 That's true
6 and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
7 That's right,
8 you sure don't.
9 At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	4
1 Well, I I haven't reached that point yet.
2 I've heard people say that.
3 But, uh, my middle son is engaged,
4 my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
5 Uh-huh.
6 He's out of college and has a good job,
7 Uh-huh.
8 so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,
2 but she's still in college
3 and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
4 Uh-huh.
5 That's what she plans to do.
6 Well, I don't blame you for that.
7 So, I hope so.
8 Well, I have the three girls
9 and then we ended up with four grandsons.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, ho-ho.
2 And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
3 A whole new world.
4 Uh-huh.
5 And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses
6 I can understand.
7 It feels,
8 after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,
9 they know everything.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Uh-huh.
2 But, they're fun.
3 So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
4 Well, I just watch them.
5 Yeah.
6 I I never did put things up when my kids were little
7 and I haven't with them.
8 I try to teach them not to get into things.
9 Well, that's the same thing that I did.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	5
1 I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
2 I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.
3 At least my daughters have.
4 They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.
1 Do you know
2 I don't know what to think.
3 I, I, uh,
4 the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort.
5 I want to believe that, that they really are trying to change. That, that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society
6 and I, I want to believe it's all okay.
7 Uh-huh.
8 But then there's that side of me that says, yeah,
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 so, so it's like there is a struggle within me going do, do I be open-minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality.
2 You know I, I trust people.
3 Uh-huh.
4 I'll do that.
5 Or do I keep on going, well, we'll wait and see
6 Well, I think there's a, a struggle within the Soviet Union.
7 Um, I think the people are, are just fed up,
8 and I think it's showing
9 and all the republic is trying to gain their independence,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	6
1 and I think, uh, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working.
2 Yeah,
3 that's it's not just a or, uh, western society telling you it's, it doesn't work.
4 Right.
5 You know, they've always said, you know, the, the Soviet people were united,
6 we believe this,
7 and maybe they are seeing that, no, no, hey, we don't believe this, you know.
8 That's right.
9 I think,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I guess I keep that one part of me that's like,
2 well, I don't know I want to trust them
3 and I,
4 it's like I can't,
5 and maybe it's because, you know, we've had our own propaganda over the years,
6 I don't know.
7 Well, that, that could be.
8 You know what I,
9 we always, we think of the K G B and we think such bad things, you know.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, you know.
2 And they probably do the same things.
3 exactly.
4 They do.
5 You think the C I A doesn't spy?
6 I'm sure they do.
7 Oh, yeah,
8 they do, you know.
9 Now the difference is we don't, I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 You know, I think to that extent we don't go as far
2 but I'm sure they lie. You know?
3 Oh, yeah.
4 Oh, absolutely.
5 So,
6 That's part of that propaganda thing,
7 and I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, oh,
8 excuse me, I've got a cold today.
9 That's all right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I hope you get better
2 Thank you.
3 Um, I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are seeing, seeing it, you know, thinking K G B and C I A and all that
4 but, uh just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they are, they ain't going to be able to feed their people this, this winter, you know.
5 Yeah.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah.
8 That's true.
9 And I'm not against them being concerned
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and, and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own.
2 Right.
3 You know, I mean, you know, any, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, you know, because I, I understand that, you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.
4 Right.
5 But at the same time I, I agree.
6 I don't think we can do it and, and just, you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here.
7 That's right.
8 You know, we've got, uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.
9 I think the problem is, you know,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 on the international scope maybe the president feels that, uh, you know, for long-term relations with all these countries it's important
2 and well, we'll, we'll always have the United States.
3 And, you know, we need to solve these international problems
4 but, um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.
5 Yeah,
6 we, we, we believe in what he's doing abroad
7 but, but like you said there's issues here too.
8 Right.
9 And but I, I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	8
1 I'm encouraged by what's happened in, you know, the, the iron curtain countries, you know, in, in that block
2 Right.
3 and, and I think it's moved in the right direction.
4 I, I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight.
5 Yep.
6 You know, it's not going to.
7 No.
8 It didn't happen here overnight,
9 That's right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 That's right.
2 And I, I think sometimes we forget that.
3 But I, I, I, I have to say, yes, I'm, you know, I'm encouraged by the way it's going. Uh,
4 uh,
1 So how do you get most of your current event information?
2 Well, , see I'm going to school right now,
3 and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,
4 Uh-huh.
5 and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,
6 and I do, like to do other stuff with it.
7 Right.
8 While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,
9 Uh-huh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 and that's kind of helpful.
2 I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,
3 you keep up on what's going on.
4 That's true,
5 I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.
6 Yeah.
7 And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,
8 so.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Well, I'm a housewife,
2 I have three kids,
3 and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on.  .
4 Uh-huh.
5 Yeah.
6 Do you watch,  do you watch the network, like major network news,
7 or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?
8 Just the  regular channel  just channel eight.
9 Oh, really.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	3
1 That's our channel here
2 that's the, um, eyewitness news.
3 Uh-huh.
4 So.
5 Oh,  see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,
6 so it's kind of different.
7 Oh, uh-huh.
8 Yeah.
9 I think,  I think the, uh,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	9
1 I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,
2 but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.
3 Right.
4 And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,
5 and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.
6 Yeah.
7 Yeah,
8 exactly.
9 I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
2 Uh-huh,
3 because they can, they can only report on, I mean,
4 they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it.
5 Right.
6 Right.
7 And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,
8 I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,
9 Yeah.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.
2 Yeah.
3 Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections
4 and, I guess I do read that,
5 and I do study who's running in our area,
6 and I do study what's going on in the economy.
7 It, you know,
8 and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.
9 What kind of, see,
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,
2 and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about
3 Right.
4 but other than that I don't really read,
5 I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.
6 I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
7 Uh-huh.
8 but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles
9 or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Oh, yeah.
2 But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,
3 but I just can't seem to find the time.
4 Yeah.
5 If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.
6 Yeah.
7 But,
8 Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.
9 Right.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 But, uh.
2 Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,
3 and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.
4 You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
5 Yeah.
6 that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just  more information.
7 If they reported every,  if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour
8 Yeah.
9 But, uh.
10 Is there a topic shift 	yes	2
1 Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics
2 Oh, yeah,
3 that's,
4 they start, already they're having like, um,
5 in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,
6 and they've got like a countdown,
7 it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
8 I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.
9 Oh, really?
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 Yeah.
2 That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
3 But, uh.
4 Yeah.
5 I can't believe, I mean,
6 they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,
7 I guess people want to hear about it.
8 Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever
9 Right,
10 Is there a topic shift 	no	9
1 right.
2 and they did so well last year.
