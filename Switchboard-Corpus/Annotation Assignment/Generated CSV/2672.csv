105,B,so the cost of it is higher.,,,,1
106,A,True.,,,,1

108,A,I noticed that about things like,,,,1
109,A,"I I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,",,,,1
110,A,"but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,  what  the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.",,,,1
111,B,Uh-huh.,,,,1

113,A,"it's,",,,,1
114,A,"you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,",,,,1
