0,A,"Yes,",major topic start,,"Whether Puerto Rico should be given statehood , independence or the status quo ",0
1,A,"um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.",,,,0
2,B,"I was a resident, although very young of the of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.",,,,0
3,B,"Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.",,,,0
4,B,"Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,",,,,0
5,B,"and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.",,,,0
6,B,What is your situation?,,,,0
7,A,"Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.",,,,0
8,A,"Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.",,,,0
9,A,"Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.",,,,0
10,A,"However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.",,,,0
11,A,"I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.",off topic start,,Speaker A's experience during a trip to Puerto Rico,2
12,A,I did Peace Corps training there.,,,,2
13,B,Oh that's very interesting.,,,,2
14,A,"And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student",,,,2
15,A,"and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California",,,,2
16,A,and so the Spanish was no problem.,,,,2
17,A,"Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely",,,,2
18,A,"and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.",,,,2
19,A,"I have,",,,,2
20,A,"actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico",off topic end,,,2
21,A,"and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.",,,,0
22,B,"Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid",,,,0
23,B,"or,",,,,0
24,A,"Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,",off topic start,,speaker A's thought about how U.S would cope with aiding new states,2
25,A,"you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.",,,,2
26,A,"I've live abroad most of my life,",,,,2
27,A,"so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.",,,,2
28,A,"I lived actually in Lebanon,",,,,2
29,A,"so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.",,,,2
30,A,"So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.",,,,2
31,B,Uh-huh.,,,,2
32,A,"Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.",,,,2
33,A,"I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.",off topic end,,,2
34,B,"I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi",minor topic start,,comparing per capita of Puerto Rico and Mississippi and about the location and about people of Puerto Rico,1
35,B,"or,",,,,1
36,A,I think so.,,,,1
37,B,"Okay,",,,,1
38,B,"that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.",minor topic end,,,1
39,B,"Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.",,,,0
40,B,"I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.",minor topic start,,economy and taxes in Puerto Rico,1
41,B,"Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.",,,,1
42,B,But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.,,,,1
43,B,"I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.",,,,1
44,B,"How do you feel, though, about,",minor topic end,,,1
45,B,"well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,",,,,0
46,B,"but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student",off topic start,,speaker B talking about Alaska as a territory during his childhood  and district of Columbia.,2
47,B,and my parents were in the military at the time,,,,2
48,B,"so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.",,,,2
49,B,"I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.",,,,2
50,B,"The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.",,,,2
51,A,Uh-huh.,,,,2
52,A,"Yeah,",,,,2
53,A,"those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.",off topic end,,,2
54,A,"Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,",minor topic start,,how taxes and education is been taken care in the territory Puerto Rico and comparison being a state and a territory.,1
55,A,I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.,,,,1
56,B,Uh-huh.,,,,1
57,B,"Uh, I see what you mean,",,,,1
58,B,"so that,",,,,1
59,B,"Yeah,",,,,1
60,B,taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.,,,,1
61,B,"Uh, there,",,,,1
62,B,"I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.",,,,1
63,B,"Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,",,,,1
64,B,"I,",,,,1
65,B,and I'm thinking in terms of education.,,,,1
66,B,But then again each state sets its own,,,,1
67,B,and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.,,,,1
68,B,"Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization",,,,1
69,B,"and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country",,,,1
70,B,"so,",,,,1
71,A,Uh-huh.,minor topic end,,,1
72,A,"Well, well actually I",,,,0
73,A,"one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.",,,,0
74,A,"So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.",,,,0
75,B,"Uh-huh,",,,,0
76,B,well that's interesting too.,,,,0
77,B,"Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.",,,,0
78,A,"I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.",,,,0
79,B,"And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.",,,,0
80,B,"So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.",,,,0
81,A,Well that's interesting.,,,,0
82,A,Right.,,,,0
83,A,"What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.",,,,0
84,B,"I think I would be troubled,",,,,0
85,B,"I suspect, I believe that any of our states,",off topic start,,common language for one country,2
86,B,"and I,",,,,2
87,B,constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.,,,,2
88,B,"Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.",,,,2
89,B,I would be bothered by that.,,,,2
90,B,"I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths",,,,2
91,B,"and that's the, the, the melting pot.",,,,2
92,A,Uh-huh.,,,,2
93,B,"Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,",,,,2
94,B,"but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past",,,,2
95,B,"and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.",,,,2
96,A,Uh-huh.,,,,2
97,B,"And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.",,,,2
98,B,"Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make",,,,2
99,B,and I think that that they would need to reassess that.,off topic end,,,2
100,B,"Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.",off topic start,,discussion about being bilingual.,2
101,A,"Uh-huh,",,,,2
102,A,uh-huh.,,,,2
103,A,"That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California",,,,2
104,A,and I didn't have any problem with my students,,,,2
105,A,"but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school",,,,2
106,A,and he can't speak a word.,,,,2
107,B,Um.,,,,2
108,A,"And so, obviously it didn't work in California.",,,,2
109,B,"Yeah,",,,,2
110,B,"but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,",,,,2
111,A,Right.,,,,2
112,B,and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.,,,,2
113,A,Right.,,,,2
114,B,"But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.",,,,2
115,A,"Oh, I see.",,,,2
116,B,"Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.",off topic end,,,2
117,A,"Uh-huh,",,,,0
118,A,uh-huh.,major topic end,,,0
