4,A,they have fifty thousand students there.,,,,1
5,A,"And I feel like that now if I went, if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have, have gotten as much exposure to different people and different, uh, I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.",,,,1

8,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
9,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
10,B,"And I, I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,",,,,1
11,A,Huh.,,,,1
12,B,"and  we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds,  and so forth,",,,,1
13,A,Huh.,,,,1
14,B,"so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,",,,,1
15,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
16,B,"um,  one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand,  and,  and, you know,  different perspectives,",,,,1
17,A,Right.,,,,1
18,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
19,A,Yeah.,,,,1

22,A,"Yeah,",,,,1
23,A,"I, I could see, I could see that point, I could see how it would be.",,,,1
24,A,"I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, um, because like we would have biology classes that did, main courses that everyone has to take, I mean, hundreds of students in this class,",,,,1
25,A,"so,  actually,  yes, you were a number.",,,,1
26,B,Yeah.,,,,1
27,A,"But, um, I, I just,",,,,1
28,A,"I don't know,",,,,1
29,A,"I'm thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.",,,,1
30,A,"It just seems like in a larger college you, I don't know, your exposed to so many more people from all over the world,",,,,1
31,A,"and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of, of the different cultures there,",,,,1
32,B,"Uh-huh,",,,,1
33,B,yeah.,,,,1
34,A,"not that  it's, not that it's better",,,,1

37,A,"Uh-huh,",,,,1

41,A,"or they're considering going to Baylor,",,,,1
42,A,they're also considering going to U T Austin,,,,1
43,A,"but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students,",,,,1

47,A,"I have a job,",,,,1
48,A,"I have my friends,",,,,1
49,B,Uh-huh,,,,1
50,A,"and I'm  really not as, as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big, a big university, you're not as concerned about the entire university,  but  your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and things like that.",,,,1
51,B,Yeah.,,,,1
52,B,"I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school,  but  what, what is the particular needs of the students",,,,1
53,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
54,B,"and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, um, larger university setting,  some  of the students, um, when I was, when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that.",,,,1
55,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
56,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
57,B,"They needed, uh, at least at first,  they needed  a smaller setting that, that was more like family where they could get one-on-one,  from,  from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, where, when they had a little more self-confidence built up, oh, yes, I can do this, oh, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,",minor topic end,,,1

64,B,"but it's these other things that you and I are, are keying off on,  that,  that are really more of an education that,",,,,1

79,A,but it wasn't like a real priority.,,,,1
80,B,Right.,,,,1
81,A,"To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be getting into as many organizations as I possibly could,",,,,1
82,A,"and, and one other point I was going to make, was that I can I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends,  because  you, like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows everybody,",,,,1
83,B,Huh.,,,,1
84,B,Yeah.,,,,1
85,A,"and  so, you probably come out of it knowing, and by friends, I mean, like contacts for when you get out of school, um, you know,",,,,1

106,A,Wow.,,,,1
107,B,"and  it's, it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in,",,,,1
108,A,Uh-huh.,,,,1
109,B,"you  know, we weren't all out to be teachers or, or whatever",,,,1
110,B,"so we didn't have the same classes,",,,,1

112,A,Right.,,,,1
113,A,Wow.,,,,1
114,A,That's great.,,,,1

130,B,Uh-huh.,,,,1
131,A,"and, and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school,",,,,1

135,A,"and so it was, you know,",,,,1

140,A,"so, she, you know,",,,,1
141,A,"that's probably,  you know, what she, what she wants anyway",,,,1
142,A,but that was the big deal,,,,1
143,A,"and,",,,,1

145,A,Right.,,,,1
146,A,Right.,,,,1
147,A,"And that, that's another point is that, the, a parent should tell their child to be or, or to give their child the leeway to choose their school,  not  so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do.",,,,1
